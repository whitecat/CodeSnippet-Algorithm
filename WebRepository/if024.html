<p>Changes are coming in the way Java installs itself, at least under Windows.<br>See <a
 href="http://blogs.eweek.com/cheap_hack/content/patches/sun_to_pick_up_java_droppings_in_future.html">Sun to Pick Up Java
    Droppings in Future</a> by Larry Seltzer (August 10, 2008).</p>

<h3>&nbsp; Installing Java from <a name="Sun&nbsp;"> Sun</a> for IE&nbsp;</h3>
<p>There are multiple URLs for downloading and installing the Sun JVM:</p>
<ul style="line-height:150%;">
  <li><b><a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp</a>
         My preference</b>. Opt for the manual download.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.java.com">www.java.com</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Click on the big blue Free Java Download button</li>
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava">java.sun.com/getjava</a>&nbsp;
        Click on the big blue Free Java Download button</li>
  <li>Another reliable page from Sun for downloading the latest version of Java is
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a>.
     The intended audience for this page however is computer nerds, so don't expect
     to understand most of it. Look for the &quot;Java&nbsp;SE&nbsp;Runtime&nbsp;Environment&nbsp;(JRE)&quot; download.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Since, for all practical purposes Sun Microsystems owns Java, you'd think they would tell you the<b> latest version</b>.
  But, like any large organization it seems as if the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. They have
  multiple Java Testers and neither has reliably reported the latest version (for more see the Other Testers page).
  This dedicated <a href="http://java.com/en/download/windows_xpi.jsp">Java download page</a>  has also been offering old
  versions (in October 2006, it was three releases back, though in March 2007 it was current).&nbsp;Then again according
  to this posting at Ed Foster's GripeLog: <a href="http://www.gripe2ed.com/scoop/story/2006/11/6/11317/4292">Sun Never
  Sets on Java Security Updates</a>, the situation is even worse with Sun withdrawing new versions for being buggy all
  the time.</p>

<p>On Febraruy 3, 2009 Sun was again inconsistent as to the latest version of Java. The
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java SE downloads</a> page showed JRE 6 Update 12
      as the latest, but the <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Java Downloads for All Operating
      Systems</a> page showed Version 6 Update 11 as the latest.</li>

<p>If your current version of Java is not the latest, I suggest <b> un-installing
   your current version</b>, then downloading the manually installable version
  (link above) and using that to install the new version. On the manual download page, opt for the
   &quot;offline installation&quot;. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Windows machines, Java is un-installed in the normal manner, with &quot;Add/Remove
Programs&quot; in the Control Panel. However, there is no entry with the word
&quot;Java&quot; in it. That would be too easy. Look for an entry that starts
with &quot;J2SE Runtime Environment&quot;.<br>
 <span style="font-size:8pt;">Interestingly, after un-installing Java, Firefox 1.0.5 had no
  Java available to it at all,but IE v6 fell back to using Microsoft's JVM.</span></p>

<p>If Sun's Java automatically updated itself, it is known to leave the older versions
hanging around. This is particularly bad because it may be possible for an
attacker to exploit known bugs in the older versions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the Java installation, a SunJavaUpdateSched program is added to the
list of programs that run automatically at start-up time. The program is
jusched.exe and it resides in the bin subdirectory of the Java directory in
C:\Program files. If you have a firewall that protects outbound connections, it
should notify you of this new program trying to make an outbound connection. You
should be able to prevent Java from self-updating by not
allowing this program to run automatically at startup time. Or, the Java control panel
applet has a checkbox that lets you turn self-updating on/off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To verify the Java installation in Internet Explorer, go to Tools -> Internet
Options -&gt; Advanced tab. In the Java settings section there should be a
checkmark in the &quot;Java (Sun)&quot; section in the box to use the version of
Java you just installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can configure which web browsers on your computer use the Sun version of
Java via the Java applet in the Control Panel.</p>

<a name="Mozilla"></a>
<h3 style="margin-top:40px;">&nbsp;Installing Java With Firefox</h3>

<p>After following the procedure above to install Java with IE, Firefox should automatically use
   the newly installed version of Java.</p>
<p>Note: There is a bug in Firefox version 3 (last verified using v3.0.4) that the auto-install of Java does not work.
   In Firefox version 2, the first time you encountered a page that used Java, Firefox automatically detected
   this and walked through a simple procedure to install Java. This no longer works in version 3 of Firefox. </p>

<p>Read all about <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firefox_:_FAQs_:_Install_Java">Java
in Firefox and Sea Monkey</a>, including how to install, enable, disable and
test. A reader of this site who was having problems getting Java to run in Firefox
was helped by the tip to: "Remove outdated Java files from the browser plugins folder".</p>

<hr width="80%" size="1" color="orange">

<p><b>Mozilla v1.4</b> uses Java from Sun. The link trail starts the same as
     with version 1.6 (above) and leads eventually to
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/getjava/manual.html">java.sun.com/getjava/manual.html</a>.
      The installation process involved 4 or 5 separate downloads and at least 5
      prompts from my firewall asking if different programs could access the
      Internet. During the lengthy install process you are asked if you want the
      new Sun Java to be linked to Internet Explorer and/or Mozilla. I told it hook up both
      browsers to the new Java version and this worked fine. Both browsers eventually
      showed themselves to be running Java version 1.4.2_02 from Sun Microsystems.</p>
 <p>The install process requires a re-start of Windows, after which my
      firewall asked about still another program that wanted to access the
      Internet, a Java updater. I allowed Java updater to access the web and it immediately found an update
      to the just installed Java. The Java updater now runs in the system tray.
      It wanted to install version 1.4.2_03-b02. Sun's Java also comes with a
      plugin manager that I used to revert IE back to using the old Microsoft JVM.</p>

<h3 style="margin-top:40px;">&nbsp;Apple Macintosh Java</h3>

<p>If you do not have Java and are using Mac OS 8.1 - 9.2.2, then download and
install the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/download.html">Macintosh

<a name="RemovingMicrosoft"></a>
<h3 style="margin-top:40px;">&nbsp;Removing Microsoft Java</h3>

<p>Microsoft has software to remove their JVM from your computer, but you have
to beg them to get it. And you have to prove that you are experiencing a problem
that will be fixed by removing their JVM. Quoting from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/826878">Availability of the Microsoft JVM Removal Tool</a>:</p>
<p>&quot;<i>Because the MSJVM Removal Tool affects the whole system, and because these effects are not reversible, it was decided that this utility would be made available only to system administrators, to network administrators, and to other IT professionals.
If you meet, understand, and agree to the criteria that are described in the "Resolution" section, please contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the MSJVM Removal Tool.&quot;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>In the old days, you could get the &quot;Removal Tool&quot; from Microsoft
here: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=f2002119-b4d5-4013-83bc-4a8ad95e959f&amp;DisplayLang=en">MSJVM Removal Tool 1.0a.</a>&nbsp;No
more. However, <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/">Major Geeks</a> still makes
the download available at: <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/download.php?det=4158">MSJVM Removal Tool 1.0a</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From Sun: <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/uninstall_msvm.xml">How do I uninstall Microsoft Virtual Machine?</a>&nbsp;
When I tried these un-install instructions on two different Windows 2000 SP4+
machines, it didn't
work. The RunDll32 command, which is the first step to removal, failed with
&quot;could not locate inf file java.inf&quot;. (July 2005)&nbsp;</p>
<p>helpwithwindows.com has instructions on <a href="http://www.helpwithwindows.com/WindowsXP/howto-21.html">Removing

<h3 style="margin-top:40px;">&nbsp;Microsoft  Java Status</h3>

<p>This section used to be called &quot;Installing Microsoft Java&quot; but
those days are gone. Microsoft is getting out of the JVM business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Support for the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine was scheduled to end September 30, 2004.
However, on April 2, 2004 Sun and Microsoft signed a new agreement that extends Microsoft's license to use Sun's Java source code and compatibility test suites until December 31, 2007. This allows Microsoft to support their
JVM until <b> December 31, 2007</b>. However, the Microsoft JVM is no longer available
from Microsoft and Microsoft products that include it, will be replaced by versions
without it. There will be no enhancements to the Microsoft JVM and there may or
may not be forthcoming fixes for any newly discovered bugs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the current status of Microsoft and Java from Microsoft at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/java">www.microsoft.com/java</a>.&nbsp;
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/java/">alternate link</a>). Also see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;299672&amp;Product=winxp">Microsoft Virtual Machine Updates Are Available Only from Windows Update</a>
(Microsoft Knowledge Base Article - 299672. Last reviewed September 27, 2004).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some versions of Windows included the Microsoft JVM. The original version of <b>Windows XP</b> did not include
it. Then
Microsoft included their JVM in Service Pack 1 for XP (released September 9,
2002). Then Microsoft removed their JVM from Service Pack 1 and re-released
it as SP1a in February 3, 2003. Service Pack 1a is the same as Service Pack 1
except that the Microsoft JVM is removed in SP1a. Microsoft Knowledge Base
Article - 813926 <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;813926">Differences
Between Windows XP SP1 and Windows XP SP1a</a> discusses this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing Service Pack 4 to <b>Windows 2000</b> has no effect at all on the
Microsoft JVM. It neither installs nor updates nor removes the JVM. Quoting <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;820101">Microsoft</a>:
<i>&quot;If you try to install a recent version of the Microsoft VM (version
3809 or later) on a Windows 2000 SP4-based computer that does not already have
the Microsoft VM installed, you receive the following error message: Microsoft
VM This setup will only upgrade over an existing version of the Microsoft
VM.&quot;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p> To check if the Microsoft JVM is installed on your computer, see the <a href="version.html">version</a>
page. If you do have it, updates will be supplied by <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/">Windows Update</a>. For
more on this see&nbsp;Microsoft Knowledge Base Article - 299672: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q299672">Microsoft

<p>Scott Finnie, in his <a href="http://www.scotsnewsletter.com/32.htm#winxpsp1">newsletter
of September 26, 2002</a>, wrote about confusion over Java when installing
Service Pack 1 for Windows XP.&nbsp; If you have XP SP1 and have an old version
of the Microsoft JVM installed, you can read Scott's instructions, in the <a href="http://www.scotsnewsletter.com/33.htm#winxprep">October
11, 2002 issue of his newsletter</a>, for installing the newer Microsoft JVM
from either the CD-ROM version of SP1 or the network version of a downloaded
copy of SP1.<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>
<p><b>Microsoft Java Bugs</b></p>
<p>July 2005. A security bug was discovered that could give an attacker full
control over your computer. To deal with this you can either un-install the
Microsoft JVM (see above) or apply a patch. For details see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/903144.mspx">Microsoft
Security Advisory (903144)</a> and <a href="http://secunia.com/advisories/15891/">Secunia
Advisory SA15891</a>.</p>
<p>April 10, 2003. <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1002-996317.html?tag=fd_ots">Flaw
leaves Windows open to Java attack</a> By Matthew Broersma CNET News.com. The
flaw is deemed &quot;critical&quot; by Microsoft. An attacker could use it to
erase files on your hard disk, among other things. Microsoft did not bother
testing old versions of their JVM, but did verify that versions 5.0.3802 through
5.0.3809 have this flaw. Version, 3810 and later are OK and can be downloaded
using Windows Update. The technical details on the bug are available from
Microsoft as a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-011.asp">security

<p>December 12, 2002. <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-977051.html">Microsoft
warns of Java flaws</a> CNET News.com. Microsoft issued a &quot;critical&quot;
security alert for a series of Java Virtual Machine bugs, one of which could
allow a hacker to steal information or reformat the hard drives of compromised
computers. The most serious bug could enable an attacker?s Java applet to gain
control over your computer and do anything on it such as modifying and deleting
files. Below are links to two Microsoft articles on the subject, both released
on December 11, 2002. The bug fixes are available from Windows Update.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/security_bulletins/ms02-069.asp"><br>

Security Bulletin MS02-069 Flaw in Microsoft VM Could Enable System Compromise

<p>In September 2002, Microsoft issued three critical bug
fixes for their, then current, JVM. You can read about this in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-052.asp">Security
Bulletin MS02-052</a>. If you are running the Microsoft JVM up to and including
version 3805 (see above) then you should apply these bug fixes. The only way to
be sure however, if you need to apply the fixes is to dig into the registry. The
<font face="Courier New">jview</font> command, described above, is <b>not</b>
accurate enough because it will display version 3805 whether or not the bug fix
is applied. This is because applying the bug fix does not change the version of
the <font face="Courier New">msjava.dll</font> file (it remains 5.00.3805.0000).
For the details of what to look at in the registry, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;Q329077&amp;">KB
article Q329077</a>.&nbsp;The security bulletin says that if <font face="Courier New">jview</font>
displays a version greater than 3805 you are okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bug fixes can only be
applied on a computer running version 5.00.3805 of the Microsoft JVM. If you
have an earlier version, you first have to get to 3805 (Sun employees must love
this). How do you get up to 3805? Read this:&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q300845">Q300845</a>
