<p>Objects and classes are a fundamental part of object-orientated programming, and
therefore Java. A class contains both data (referred to as attributes), and executable
code (referred to as methods). In the previous tutorial, we created a class that contained
a single method ' main '. When the class was executed, the main method was called, and
the application ran as a normal program. While it is possible to use only a single class
in a Java project, this is not good practice for large applications. The power
object-orientation lies in breaking tasks down into simpler components that perform
logically related tasks. Even a moderately complex program should be composed of many
classes, which interact with each other. </p>

<p>When designing software with Java, we must deal with a large variety of classes. Each
class is a separate module, which can interact with other objects through method calls.
For example, we might design a bank account class, which acts as a record for storing
salary data. Yet we can also include functions that modify or manipulate the data, such as
calculating interest or depositing funds. </p>

<p>This class could then be <em>instantiated</em> by another class, creating a new bank
account object each time. Don't worry if this terminology seems confusing at first - it
will take a little while to sink in. We are basically creating an bank account object
(which contains attributes and methods) that is defined by our bank account class. Each
person would need there own bank account object - but all bank accounts share the same
template (our bank account class).</p>

<p>We can instantiate an object by using the <font color="blue">new</font> keyword, and
passing initialisation parameters. These parameters are evaluated by a special function
called the constructor. The constructor is responsible for setting up the initial state of
an object. Instead of declaring an object, and calling a special setup routine, a
constructor is called automatically when the <font color="blue">new</font> keyword is
used. For example, to create a new account, we might specify the initial balance, and it's
defined for us without having to modify the attribute directly. </p>

<p>Of course, the constructor method isn't the only method that can change the attributes
of an object. We can define other methods and then call them from our code. For example,
we might define a deposit method for a bank account object. To call the method of an
object, the syntax is <strong>object name</strong>.method name(<em>params</em>). </p>

<p>A simple example of constructing an object, and calling a method is given below. A
function ' create_account ' instantiates a new account, deposits some money, and returns
the account. <!-- Code snippet --> </p>
<code>

<pre>
  <font color="green">// Create_account creates an account, deposits money,
     and returns an account</font>
  <font color="blue">public</font> account create_account(<font color="blue">double</font> balance)
  {
     account my_account;

     <font color="green">// Instantiate a new object</font>
     my_account = <font color="blue">new</font> account(balance);

     <font color="green">// Call the deposit method of our object my_account</font>
     my_account.deposit(25.00);

     <font color="blue">return</font> account;
  }
</pre>
</code>

<p>To do the same thing in C, we would create a new instance of this bank account
structure, and then we'd have to call functions that take the structure as a pointer
reference. If you've used pointers before, you might appreciate just how handy it would be
to have functions built into a structure. </p>

<p>After seeing how to instantiate an object, it might be a good time to examine how a
class is defined. Carrying on from the original theme of an account, we'll specify an
account class. The account class will need a constructor, and several methods such as
deposit and withdraw. You can either type out the java source file yourself, copy it to
the clipboard from this document, or download it directly. 

<ul>
  <li><a href="Account.java" target><img src="../images/disk.gif" border="NO" img align="CENTER" width="32" height="32"></a><a href="Account.java">Account.java</a></li>
  <li><a href="AccountDemo.java" target><img src="../images/disk.gif" border="NO" img align="CENTER" width="32" height="32"></a><a href="AccountDemo.java">AccountDemo.java</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>It's also important to provide a public method for obtaining the balance, as we must
hide from view the balance attribute. One of the handy features of object-orientation is
that we can make private and protect from view certain attributes. This offers good
security, as to change the value of these protected attributes a public method must be
called. Thus, in this example, we can change the balance on our terms (through a
withdrawal or deposit), instead of allowing some external object to change it for us. </p>

<hr>

<p>After reading through the code, you'll probably have noticed that there are two
functions called Account. A function that shares the same name as a class is always the
constructor, but how can there be two? </p>

<p>Function overloading allows us to have more than one method interface. We can have a
method that takes a <font color="blue">double</font> as a parameter, or one that has no
value at all. This is handy, because we could refer to the constructor in more than one
way. </p>
<code>

<pre>
        my_account = <font color="BLUE">new</font> account(250.0);
        my_account = <font color="BLUE">new</font> account();
</pre>
</code>

<p>Function overloading need not just apply to constructor methods either. We could create
a function that takes multiple parameters, yet has a default set of parameters if no
values are passed. It's even possible to specify different return types! We'll cover this
in a future tutorial, but for now, we'll go through demonstration code that uses the
Account class we created earlier. </p>

<p>In the following code, we create a new account (this time specifying no parameters).
After depositing some money into the account, we call the println method learned in our
first tutorial, and give it a string concatenated with the return value of getbalance (in
this case, a double). One of the great features of Java is that it offers implicit type
conversion to strings, and thus we do not need to covert a double value into a string. </p>

<p>After printing the balance, we withdraw money from the account, and then reprint the
balance. You'll notice that we again concatenate a string with the return result of
getbalance, using the ' + ' operator. </p>

<p align="left">After running the code, feel free to modify some of the parameter values,
and call different methods of Account to gain some experience with method calls under
Java. In the next tutorial, we'll put to use some of our knowledge of classes, and cover
file processing using the Java IO classes. </p>
