Recorded before a live audience at The Java House in downtown Iowa City, the one-hour show offers an eclectic mix of live tunes from the vibrant independent music scene. Ben Kieffer infuses the performances with lively chats to find out about the artists' music and lives.</p>

She sings rock. She sings jazz. What makes this girl different from other girls with guitars? The full six piece show you hear coming out of this lone girl on stage. Tiffany Christopher's multiple-personality vocals, bouncing guitar, and invisible percussion coming from her hands, feet, and voice will entrance you.

In 2008, she called off an engagement, joined a band, and taught herself how to play her father's accordion. &quot;The songs just began pouring out, it was like opening a flood gate.&quot; Less than six months later, she released her first album and began touring as a solo artist. The name, Pezzettino, refers to the children&rsquo;s illustration book by Leo Lionni, and in an interview Stutt stated, &quot;It means little piece; the story is about realizing one&rsquo;s self-worth and independence.&quot;&nbsp; Now with four releases under her belt including the catchy new 7&quot; vinyl single, &quot;You Never Know,&quot; Pezzettino is gaining momentum with three more records in the works.&nbsp; More info at <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">myspace.com/pezzettino</strong></p><hr /><a name="113"></a><h3><img src=".//images/javaBlend/Ben Schmidt.jpg" align="right" style="padding: 0 0 10px 10px;" />Friday, February 26 and Saturday, February 27<br />Ben Schmidt with Larry Mossman</h3><p>Ben Schmidt?s warm, versatile voice, alternately sweet and dark, colors compositions from ballads to blues. Called "an extraordinary talent" and "the total package" by music critic Jim Musser (No Depression), Schmidt is influenced by a vast range of musicians and musical genres, most prominently folk and Mississippi delta blues. 
His third and latest CD "Silt" is an exploration of arrangement and musical texture as the backdrop for lyrics based in a post-flood landscape. The stories and images in these songs are from the perspective of people who have experienced "storms" --physical, emotional, and spiritual. They describe in terms simple and poetic, what precipitated, what transpired, and what remains when the waters recede. Mandolin player Larry Mossman will team up with Schmidt for the Java Blend performance. More info at myspace.com/benschmidtmusic
</p><hr /><a name="114"></a><h3><img src=".//images/javaBlend/Vance Gilbert.jpg" align="right" style="padding: 0 0 10px 10px;" />Friday, March 05 and Saturday, March 06<br />Vance Gilbert</h3><p>Vance Gilbert burst onto the singer/songwriter scene in the early 90's when buzz started spreading in the folk clubs of Boston about an ex-multicultural arts teacher who was knocking 'em dead at open mics.  While considered by many to be an integral part of the New England folk scene, Gilbert's approach stands apart in significant ways. His performances often feature extended guitar and vocal techniques, and Gilbert's compositions frequently employ sophisticated melodies and harmonies that attest to his jazz roots. Several of Gilbert's songs deal with racial issues and his live show banter often touches on his being a black man in a field of music dominated by both white performers and audiences. Gilbert?s latest CD is titled Up on Rockfield. 

Gilbert?s appearance on Java Blend comes in connection with his evening performance at CSPS in Cedar Rapids on February 12.  More information at legionarts.org

The 22-year-old?s Vanguard debut album, What to Say documents Willis? voyage of self-discovery, while also standing as a captivating introduction to a remarkably fresh voice with a distinctive point of view?one that both reflects and scrutinizes the social patterns of her generation.

Hurled into a depression by the state of the music industry and the pressures endured by full-time independent artists, Douglass took a break from touring and drew himself in for a long, dark Vermont winter. After a winter love affair with the HBO series "Six Feet Under," Douglass was bewitched by the haunting and compelling questions raised by the show. The result is his latest and seventh album Battler. He says, "Writing and recording this album has been a cathartic experience ? after a rock-bottom winter of red wine and unexpected inspiration, I've come to the conclusion that I undoubtedly need to continue making music." Instinct Magazine writes that Douglass' evocative, alternative sound "channels everyone from Stevie Wonder to Fiona Apple in a way that's terrifyingly mature for someone so young."

Skye has been writing &amp; performing her own music ever since, with special inspiration from her first chamber-pop band, Skursula. Skye calls on company of J.S.

Holed up in a rural cabin with minimal recording gear and a houseful of instruments, she recorded her new songs alone and off the clock, in late night sessions that yielded layers of intimate vocals combined with nylon string and electric guitars, cellos, keyboards, and percussion.

He was at the forefront of the wave of singer/songwriters that emerged from the Boston folk scene in the 1990&rsquo;s and helped renew interest in the genre, successfully bridging the gulf between the modern folk sound and the populist traditions of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. Paul&rsquo;s current studio album release <em>The Day After Everything Changed</em> is completely fan funded and his first without a record label in 10 years. </p>

The son of Bo Ramsey, Benson was reared on folk and blues music and continues to let those influences shine, even on louder electric songs. David also has a deep love for traditional music, and together the two craft songs that evoke the ancient while incorporating newer rock and pop grooves. The Pines new CD, titled Tremolo, showcases the duo&rsquo;s unique songwriting and musicianship.</p></div><h3><a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHideLayer(7);"><img src="/images/plus.png" title="Expand" name="btn7"  border ="0" id="btn7" /></a> November 27, 2009: Keri Noble</h3><div id="box7" class="collapsible"><img src=".//images/javaBlend/Noble14_10x13_Joel-Larson_800_thumb.jpg" align="right" style="padding: 0 0 10px 10px;" /><p>The Minneapolis-based acoustic pop/soul singer-songwriter Keri Noble visits IPR&rsquo;s &quot;Java Blend&quot; November 13. Given her roots in Detroit, it would be easy to assume that Keri Noble grew up in the &rsquo;80s surrounded by the rich musical history and culture of the Motor City. But that is not the case. The daughter of a Christian pastor in a small, Spanish-speaking church on Detroit&rsquo;s southwest side, Noble was raised in a strict household where secular music was generally frowned upon. But by her late teens she&rsquo;d heard enough bits and pieces of R&amp;B, hip-hop and other urban sounds to understand that there was an entire world outside the walls of the church. And thanks to the inspiration of Joni Mitchell, Noble began songwriting.</p></div><h3><a href="javascript:;" onclick="ShowHideLayer(8);"><img src="/images/plus.png" title="Expand" name="btn8"  border ="0" id="btn8" /></a> November 20, 2009: Big Blue Sky</h3><div id="box8" class="collapsible"><p>Hailing from northeast Iowa, the musical group Big Blue Sky brings their vibrant, eclectic sound to IPR&rsquo;s Java Blend for the first time.
