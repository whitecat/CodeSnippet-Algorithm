The precise meaning
of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
intent is that, for any object <tt>x</tt>, the expression:
<blockquote>
<pre>
x.clone() != x</pre></blockquote>
will be true, and that the expression:
<blockquote>
<pre>
x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</pre></blockquote>
will be <tt>true</tt>, but these are not absolute requirements.
While it is typically the case that:
<blockquote>
<pre>
x.clone().equals(x)</pre></blockquote>
will be <tt>true</tt>, this is not an absolute requirement.
<p>
By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
<tt>super.clone</tt>.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except
<tt>Object</tt>) obey this convention, it will be the case that
<tt>x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()</tt>.
<p>
By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
by <tt>super.clone</tt> before returning it.  Typically, this means
copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
the case that no fields in the object returned by <tt>super.clone</tt>
need to be modified.
<p>
The method <tt>clone</tt> for class <tt>Object</tt> performs a
specific cloning operation. First, if the class of this object does
not implement the interface <tt>Cloneable</tt>, then a
<tt>CloneNotSupportedException</tt> is thrown. Note that all arrays
are considered to implement the interface <tt>Cloneable</tt>.
Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method
performs a "shallow copy" of this object, not a "deep copy" operation.
<p>
The class <tt>Object</tt> does not itself implement the interface
<tt>Cloneable</tt>, so calling the <tt>clone</tt> method on an object
whose class is <tt>Object</tt> will result in throwing an
exception at run time.</ul></td></tr><tr><td><pre><a href='javascript:src("ms1")'><img id='ms1i' src=/plus.gif border=0></a> public boolean<a name='equals(Object)'> <b>equals</b>(<a href=/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html>Object</a> obj)</a> <pre id='ms1' style='height:1px;overflow:hidden;visibility:hidden;width:100%'>{

<p>
The <code>equals</code> method implements an equivalence relation
on non-null object references:
<ul>
<li>It is <i>reflexive</i>: for any non-null reference value
    <code>x</code>, <code>x.equals(x)</code> should return
    <code>true</code>.
<li>It is <i>symmetric</i>: for any non-null reference values
    <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, <code>x.equals(y)</code>
    should return <code>true</code> if and only if
    <code>y.equals(x)</code> returns <code>true</code>.
<li>It is <i>transitive</i>: for any non-null reference values
    <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>, if
    <code>x.equals(y)</code> returns <code>true</code> and
    <code>y.equals(z)</code> returns <code>true</code>, then
    <code>x.equals(z)</code> should return <code>true</code>.
<li>It is <i>consistent</i>: for any non-null reference values
    <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, multiple invocations of
    <tt>x.equals(y)</tt> consistently return <code>true</code>
    or consistently return <code>false</code>, provided no
    information used in <code>equals</code> comparisons on the
    objects is modified.
<li>For any non-null reference value <code>x</code>,
    <code>x.equals(null)</code> should return <code>false</code>.
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>equals</tt> method for class <code>Object</code> implements
the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
that is, for any non-null reference values <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code>, this method returns <code>true</code> if and only
if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> refer to the same object
(<code>x == y</code> has the value <code>true</code>).
<p>
Note that it is generally necessary to override the <tt>hashCode</tt>
method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
general contract for the <tt>hashCode</tt> method, which states
that equal objects must have equal hash codes.</ul></td></tr><tr><td><pre><a href='javascript:src("ms2")'><img id='ms2i' src=/plus.gif border=0></a> protected  void<a name='finalize'> <b>finalize</b>()</a> throws <a href=/docs/api/java/lang/Throwable.html>Throwable</a> <pre id='ms2' style='height:1px;overflow:hidden;visibility:hidden;width:100%'>{

}</pre></pre><ul>Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
determines that there are no more references to the object.
A subclass overrides the <code>finalize</code> method to dispose of
system resources or to perform other cleanup.
<p>
The general contract of <tt>finalize</tt> is that it is invoked
if and when the Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> virtual
machine has determined that there is no longer any
means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
finalized. The <tt>finalize</tt> method may take any action, including
making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
of <tt>finalize</tt>, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
permanently discarded.
<p>
The <tt>finalize</tt> method of class <tt>Object</tt> performs no
special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
<tt>Object</tt> may override this definition.
<p>
The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
invoke the <tt>finalize</tt> method for any given object. It is
guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
<p>
After the <tt>finalize</tt> method has been invoked for an object, no
further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
at which point the object may be discarded.
<p>
The <tt>finalize</tt> method is never invoked more than once by a Java
virtual machine for any given object.
<p>
Any exception thrown by the <code>finalize</code> method causes
the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
ignored.</ul></td></tr><tr><td><pre><img id='ms3i' src=/empty.gif border=0> public final native <a href=/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html>Class</a>&lt;?&gt;<a name='getClass'> <b>getClass</b>()</a><ul>Returns the runtime class of this {@code Object}. The returned

<p><b>The actual result type is {@code Class<? extends |X|>}
where {@code |X|} is the erasure of the static type of the
expression on which {@code getClass} is called.</b> For
example, no cast is required in this code fragment:</p>

{@code Number n = 0;                             }<br>

supported for the benefit of hashtables such as those provided by
<code>java.util.Hashtable</code>.
<p>
The general contract of <code>hashCode</code> is:
<ul>
<li>Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
    an execution of a Java application, the <tt>hashCode</tt> method
    must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
    used in <tt>equals</tt> comparisons on the object is modified.
    This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
    application to another execution of the same application.
<li>If two objects are equal according to the <tt>equals(Object)</tt>
    method, then calling the <code>hashCode</code> method on each of
    the two objects must produce the same integer result.
<li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
    according to the <a href='/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)'>java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)</a> 
    method, then calling the <tt>hashCode</tt> method on each of the
    two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
    programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
    for unequal objects may improve the performance of hashtables.
</ul>
<p>
As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
class <tt>Object</tt> does return distinct integers for distinct
objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal
address of the object into an integer, but this implementation
technique is not required by the
Java<font size="-2"><sup>TM</sup></font> programming language.)</ul></td></tr><tr><td><pre><img id='ms5i' src=/empty.gif border=0> public final native  void<a name='notify'> <b>notify</b>()</a><ul>Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's
monitor. If any threads are waiting on this object, one of them
is chosen to be awakened. The choice is arbitrary and occurs at
the discretion of the implementation. A thread waits on an object's
monitor by calling one of the <code>wait</code> methods.
<p>
The awakened thread will not be able to proceed until the current
thread relinquishes the lock on this object. The awakened thread will
compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might be
actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the
awakened thread enjoys no reliable privilege or disadvantage in being
the next thread to lock this object.
<p>
This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
of this object's monitor. A thread becomes the owner of the
object's monitor in one of three ways:
<ul>
<li>By executing a synchronized instance method of that object.
<li>By executing the body of a <code>synchronized</code> statement
    that synchronizes on the object.
<li>For objects of type <code>Class,</code> by executing a
    synchronized static method of that class.
</ul>

It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.
<p>
The <code>toString</code> method for class <code>Object</code>
returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the
object is an instance, the at-sign character `<code>@</code>', and
the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the
object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the
value of:

In other words, this method behaves exactly as if it simply
performs the call <tt>wait(0)</tt>.
<p>
The current thread must own this object's monitor. The thread
releases ownership of this monitor and waits until another thread
notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor to wake up
either through a call to the <code>notify</code> method or the
<code>notifyAll</code> method. The thread then waits until it can
re-obtain ownership of the monitor and resumes execution.
<p>
As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are
possible, and this method should always be used in a loop:
<pre>
    synchronized (obj) {
        while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
            obj.wait();
        ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
    }

of this object's monitor. See the <code>notify</code> method for a
description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
a monitor.</ul></td></tr><tr><td><pre><img id='ms10i' src=/empty.gif border=0> public final native  void<a name='wait(long)'> <b>wait</b>(long timeout)</a> throws <a href=/docs/api/java/lang/InterruptedException.html>InterruptedException</a><ul>Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the

<a href='/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#notifyAll()'>java.lang.Object#notifyAll()</a>  method for this object, or a
specified amount of time has elapsed.
<p>
The current thread must own this object's monitor.
<p>
This method causes the current thread (call it <var>T</var>) to
place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish
any and all synchronization claims on this object. Thread <var>T</var>
becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant
until one of four things happens:
<ul>
<li>Some other thread invokes the <tt>notify</tt> method for this
object and thread <var>T</var> happens to be arbitrarily chosen as
the thread to be awakened.
<li>Some other thread invokes the <tt>notifyAll</tt> method for this
object.
<li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
thread <var>T</var>.
<li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.  If
<tt>timeout</tt> is zero, however, then real time is not taken into
consideration and the thread simply waits until notified.
</ul>
The thread <var>T</var> is then removed from the wait set for this
object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It then competes in the
usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
object; once it has gained control of the object, all its
synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the <tt>wait</tt>
method was invoked. Thread <var>T</var> then returns from the
invocation of the <tt>wait</tt> method. Thus, on return from the
<tt>wait</tt> method, the synchronization state of the object and of
thread <tt>T</tt> is exactly as it was when the <tt>wait</tt> method
was invoked.
<p>
A thread can also wake up without being notified, interrupted, or
timing out, a so-called <i>spurious wakeup</i>.  While this will rarely
occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for
the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and
continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied.  In other words,
waits should always occur in loops, like this one:
<pre>
    synchronized (obj) {
        while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
            obj.wait(timeout);
        ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
    }
</pre>
(For more information on this topic, see Section 3.2.3 in Doug Lea's
"Concurrent Programming in Java (Second Edition)" (Addison-Wesley,
2000), or Item 50 in Joshua Bloch's "Effective Java Programming
Language Guide" (Addison-Wesley, 2001).

<p>If the current thread is {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#interrupt()
interrupted} by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an
<tt>InterruptedException</tt> is thrown.  This exception is not
thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as
described above.

<p>
Note that the <tt>wait</tt> method, as it places the current thread
into the wait set for this object, unlocks only this object; any
other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain
locked while the thread waits.

This method is similar to the <code>wait</code> method of one

wait for a notification before giving up. The amount of real time,
measured in nanoseconds, is given by:
