<p><b>rJava</b> is a simple R-to-Java interface. It is comparable to the <tt>.C</tt>/<tt>.Call</tt> C interface. rJava provides a low-level bridge between R and Java (via JNI). It allows to create objects, call methods and access fields of Java objects from R.
<p>
<b>rJava</b> release versions can be obtained from <a href=http://cran.r-project.org>CRAN</a> - usually <tt>install.packages("rJava")</tt> in R will do the trick. The current development version can be downloaded from the <a href=/rJava/files>files section</a>.
<p>
In a sense the inverse of rJava is <a href=/JRI/>JRI</a> (Java/R Interface) which provides the opposite direction - calling R from Java. <b>JRI</b> is now shipped as a part of the <b>rJava</b> package, although it still can be used as a separate entity (especially for development).
Currently rJava is used as a part of <a href="/JGR/">JGR</a>, <a href="/iplots/">iPlots</a> and <a href="/JavaGD/">JavaGD</a> software/packages.
<p>
Please report any bugs or wishes related to rJava or JRI using the <a href="https://www.rforge.net/cgi-bin/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=rJava">Bugzilla for rJava</a>.

<b>2009/10/27 - rJava 0.8-0</b> released. Many new features mostly thanks to Romain Francois -- check the <a href=news.html>NEWS</a> file for details.<br>
</div> 
<b>2009/08/22 - rJava 0.7-0</b> released. Recommended update (includes bugfixes to fields handling, new support for with(), method/field auto-completion and more forgiving <tt>$</tt> operator), includes JRI&nbsp;0.5-0.<br>
<p>
<b>2009/06/14 - rJava 0.6-3</b> released. Recommended update (includes bugfix for signature overflow), includes JRI 0.4-3 which supports <a href="http://rforge.net/Rserve/doc/">REngine API</a> which is now compatible both with <a href=http://rforge.net/Rserve/>Rserve</a> and rJava/JRI.
<p>
<b>2009/01/26 - rJava 0.6-2</b> released. (Recommended update for Windows users).<br>
<p>
<b>2008/12/23 - rJava 0.6-1</b> released. (Recommended update for non-UTF-8 locales).<br>
<p>
<b>2008/09/22 - rJava 0.6-0</b> released. Adds support for Java serialization and R-side cache which enables Java objects to become persistent across sessions. See <tt>?.jcache</tt> in R (or the <a href="/doc/packages/rJava/jserialize.html">online help</a>) for details.<br>
<p>
<b>2007/11/05 - rJava 0.5-1</b> released. Fixes issues with Windows; and minor updates (see NEWS).<br>
<p>
<b>2007/08/22 - rJava 0.5-0</b> released. This is a major update featuring many new features and bugfixes. It sports a new custom class loader, much improved (and faster) field support, integration of all native Java types, automatic fall-back to static methods, infrastructure for writing Java packages easily (see <tt>.jpackage</tt>), support for custom convertors and call-backs. Please read the <a href=news.html>NEWS</a> file for details.
<p>
<b>2007/02/27 - rJava 0.4-14</b> (update is recommended to all users due to memory leak fixes), please use CRAN to get the latest release. The current <i>development</i> version is <b>rJava 0.5-0</b> (available from here - see SVN access and download on the left). It is under heavy construction right now with many new features, so feel free to test-drive it if you want to be on the bleeding edge (it is a bit chatty as some debugging output is still enabled). Some of the highlights are memory profiler, intelligent class loader, easy Java package integration and callback support.
<p>
<!--
<b>2006/09/11 - rJava 0.4-8</b> released (includes JRI 0.3-2). Starting with this release, JRI is only compiled if R was built as a shared library (which is a necessary requirement anyway). Please always see CRAN for the latest version.
<p>
<b>2006/05/08 - rJava 0.4-2</b> released.<br> This version is the last of a succession of (almost daily) updates that were reflected on CRAN. The main new feature is that <a href=/JRI/>JRI</a> is now included in the rJava distribution. JRI library and classes are installed in the <tt>jri</tt> subdirectory of the installed <tt>rJava</tt> package. The installation of JRI can be disabled by using <tt>--disable-jri</tt>. Another new flag is <tt>--enable-debug</tt> which enables very verbatim debugging output.
<p>
<b>2006/04/17 - rJava 0.3-8</b> released.<br> Adds a handful features: allows dynamic change of the class path for some VMs, supports additional parameters to be passed to the VM (see <tt>.jinit</tt>), adds suport for a few more types and fixes a few minor bugs - see NEWS file inside. Update is recommended to all users, especially if you plan to use multiple packages relying on rJava.
<p>
<b>2006/01/30 - rJava 0.3-6</b> released.<br> Mostly bugfixes (Win2k compatibility, memory management, debugging) and added <tt>--enable-threads</tt> option (necessary for AWT with R GUI on OS X, but still experimental). Update strongly recommended to all users.
<p>
<b>2005/12/21 - rJava 0.3-3</b> released.<br> Arrays no longer need an explicit cast and arbitrarily nested arrays are supported as well (thanks to Kurt Hornik for very useful feedback)
<p>
<b>2005/12/19 - rJava 0.3-2</b> is now the first public release of the 0.3 series. The object references now use external pointers and automatically free Java objects if the reference was garbage-collected in R. There is no longer need for <tt>.jfree</tt>. Support for easy array construction was added in the form of the <tt>.jarray</tt> function.
<p>
<b>2005/12/03 - rJava 0.2-3</b> released and rJava is now available on CRAN.
<p>
<b>2005/09/03 - rJava 0.2-0</b> is now the first release of the "next generation" which uses S4 objects as the representation of Java objects in R. This gives us a bit more flexibility and some additional sanity checks. If you wrote a code that relies on the contents of the reference objects, you will probably need to replace <tt>$</tt> by <tt>@</tt>. Nevertheless the direct use of slots is discouraged as it can change in the future. Also the new convenience API using the <tt>$</tt> operator was introduced.

<tr><td colspan=2><b>Installation</b></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td>
<p>
First, make sure you have JDK 1.4 or higher installed (some platforms require hgher version see <a href="http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=packages:cran:rjava">R Wiki</a>). On unix systems make sure that R was configured with Java support. If not, you can re-configure R by using <tt>R CMD javareconf</tt> (you may have to prepend <tt>sudo</tt> or run it as root depending on your installation - see R-ext manual A.2.2 for details). On Windows Java is detected at run-time from the registry.
<p>
rJava can be installed as any other R package from CRAN using <tt>install.packages('rJava')</tt>. See the files section in the left menu for development versions.<p>
JRI is only compiled if supported, i.e. if R was configured as a framework or with <tt>--enable-R-shlib</tt>.

<p>
If you want to run R within a Java application, please see the <a href=/JRI/>JRI</a> pages for details. <b>rJava</b> allows you to use R code to create Java objects, call Java methods and pass data between R and Java. Most functions are already documented by the corresponding help pages in R, but here is a very basic crashcourse:
<p>
The following gives a quick guide to the use of rJava. If you have questions about installation, please visit the <a href="http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=packages:cran:rjava">R Wiki - rJava package</a>.
<p>
<style type="text/css"> tt {color: #000080} #RC {background-color: #e0e0ff; border: 2px solid #c0c0ff; padding: 10px; margin: 7px}</style>
Let's start with some low-level examples. Remember, this is all essentially a JNI interface, so you may encounter new things if you used Java from high level only.
<div id=RC class=RC>
<tt>library(rJava)</tt><br>
<tt>.jinit()</tt> <i># this starts the JVM</i><br>
<tt>s <- .jnew(<font color="#0000ff">"java/lang/String"</font>, <font color="#0000ff">"Hello World!"</font>)</tt><br>
</div>
Ok, here we have our first Java object. It is equivalent to the Java line of (pseudo) code <tt>s = new java.lang.String("Hello World!");</tt> The class name may look strange to casual Java users, but this is how JNI class names look like - slashes instead of dots. Also note that you must always refer to the full class name, because there is no <tt>import ...</tt> facility.
<p>Next, we will call a simple method:
<div id=RC class=RC>
<tt>.jcall(s,"I","length")</tt><br>
<tt><font color="#808080">[1] 12</font></tt>
</div>
This is equivalent to <tt>s.length()</tt>, but it is a bit more complex than expected. The main reason is that in JNI when looking up methods, you must supply the return type as well. So here we say that we want to call a method <tt>length</tt> on the object <tt>s</tt> with the return type <tt>I</tt> which means <tt>int</tt>. The table of JNI types is as follows:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td><tt>I</tt></td><td width=25%>integer</td>
<td><tt>D</tt></td><td width=25%>double (numeric)</td>
<td><tt>J</tt></td><td width=25%>long <a href=#types>(*)</a></td>
<td><tt>F</tt></td><td width=25%>float <a href=#types>(*)</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>V</tt></td><td>void</td><td><tt>Z</tt></td><td>boolean</td>
<td><tt>C</tt></td><td>char (integer)</td>
<td><tt>B</tt></td><td>byte (raw)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=8><tt>L&lt;class&gt;;</tt> Java object of the class &lt;class&gt; (e.g. <tt>Ljava/lang/Object;</tt>)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=8><tt>[&lt;type&gt;</tt> Array of objects of type &lt;type&gt; (e.g. <tt>[D</tt> for an array of doubles)</td></tr>
</table>
Not all types or combinations are supported, but most are. Note that the Java type <tt>short</tt> was sacrificed for greater good (and pushed to <tt>T</tt>), namely <tt>S</tt> return type specification in <tt>.jcall</tt> is a shortcut for <tt>Ljava/lang/String;</tt>. When passing parameters to methods, R objects are automatically converted where possible:
<div id=RC class=RC>
<tt>.jcall(s,"I","indexOf","World")</tt><br>
<tt><font color="#808080">[1] 6</font></tt>
</div>
This is equivalent to <tt>s.indexOf("World")</tt> and the string parameter <tt>"World"</tt> is automatically converted into <tt>java.lang.String</tt> object and passed to Java. Note that you can equally pass Java object references as well. But before we do that, let us see how you can find a method signature if you're not sure. Let's say we want to know more about the <tt>concat</tt> method for our object <tt>s</tt>:
<div id=RC class=RC>
<tt>.jmethods(s,"concat")</tt><br>
<tt><font color="#808080">[1] "public java.lang.String java.lang.String.concat(java.lang.String)"</font></tt>
</div>
We see that <tt>concat</tt> expects a string and returns a string, so we can just concatenate the string itself if we want:
<div id=RC class=RC>
<tt>.jcall(s,"Ljava/lang/String;","concat",s)</tt><br>
<tt><font color="#808080">[1] "Hello World!Hello World!"</font></tt>
</div>
We are telling JNI that the return value will be of an object of the class <tt>java.lang.String</tt> (there is a convenience shotcut of <tt>S</tt> as well). The parameter <tt>evalString</tt> is by default set to <tt>TRUE</tt> (see help for <tt>.jcall</tt>), so you don't get a reference to the new string, but the actual contents instead.
<p>There is a simple function <tt>.jstrVal</tt> that returns the content of a string reference or calls <tt>toString()</tt> method and returns the string:
<div id=RC class=RC>
<tt>print(s)<br>
<font color="#808080">[1] "Java-Object: Hello World"</font></br>
.jstrVal(s)<br>
<font color="#808080">[1] "Hello World"</font></tt>
</div>
At the end, let us create some windows and buttons using AWT:
<div id=RC class=RC>
<tt>f <- .jnew("java/awt/Frame", "Hello")<br>
b <- .jnew("java/awt/Button", "OK")<br>
.jcall(f, "Ljava/awt/Component;", "add", .jcast(b, "java/awt/Component"))<br>
.jcall(f,, "pack")<br>
.jcall(f,, "setVisible", TRUE)</tt>
</div>
This should show a simple AWT window with an OK button inside. Note that we need to cast the button <tt>b</tt> into <tt>java/awt/Component</tt>, because the method signature needs to be matched precisely (call <tt>.jmethods(f, "add")</tt> to see the expected type). You can get rid of this window by calling <tt>.jcall(f,,"dispose")</tt>.
<p>
Finally a note about the <tt>$</tt> convenience operator. It provides an experimental, but simple way of writing code in Java style at the cost of speed. Taking the String example, you can achieve the same with:
<div id=RC class=RC>
<tt>s$length()<br>
<font color="#808080">[1] 12</font><br>
s$indexOf("World")<br>
<font color="#808080">[1] 6</font></tt>
</div>
You simply use <tt>$</tt> instead of <tt>.</tt>. This interface uses Java reflection API to find the correct method so it is much slower and may not be right (works for simple examples but may not for more complex ones). For now its use is discouraged in programs as it may change in the future. However, feel free to test it and report any issues with it.
<hr>
<a name="types"></a><b>(*)</b> Note that there is no <tt>long</tt> or <tt>float</tt> type in R. Both are converted into numeric in R. In order to pass a numeric as either of the two back to Java, you will neeed to use <tt>.jfloat</tt> or <tt>.jlong</tt> functions to mark an object as belonging to one of those classes.
