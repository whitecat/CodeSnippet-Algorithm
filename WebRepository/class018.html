<p>Until now in this tutorial, the usefulness of object orientation and designing classes
may not have been readily apparent. Certainly, bringing a data structure and functions
that operate upon it together has its usefulness, but this has only just begun to scratch
the surface. The real power that comes from using classes is that of inheritance -
extending the power of existing classes. </p>

<p>Inheritance will probably be a reasonably new term for you, at least when applied to
object orientated programming. Using other languages, you may have constructed libraries
of source code, and enhanced them by adding to the original source. Inheritance offers a
radically different outlook on the re-use of code, as you shall see shortly. </p>

<p>In Java, when we wish to extend the usefulness of a class, we can create a new class
that inherits the attributes and methods of another. We don't need a copy of the original
source code (as is the case with many other languages) to extend the usefulness of a
library. We simply need a compiled '.class' file, from which we can create a new
enhancement. </p>

<p>Furthermore, instead of re-writing a class to provide (as an example) a new function,
we can simply declare we wish to extend a class, and add a few lines of code to get an
enhancement. It makes the process of re-using code much simpler, and code easier to read. </p>

<p>To illustrate this point, we're going to take some code from a previous tutorial, and
add some extra functionality to it. Remember the bank account example from <a href="../java102/java102.html">Java 102</a>? We're going to create a new class, that
calculates interest and deposits this into the account. We don't need to re-write the
original Account class, nor do we need to modify existing methods such as deposit and
withdraw. </p>

<p>When we extend an existing class, we 'inherit' all of the attributes, and methods, of
the parent class. Our new class can deposit, and withdraw - even though we never
explicitly defined new methods for those functions. This makes programming much easier,
and simpler, as we don't re-invent the wheel each time we extend other classes. </p>

<p>In the example above, we add only a single new function 'add_monthly_interest()', and
override the constructors of our parent class. Overriding will be a new term for you -
basically it means we replace the code for a function from a parent class with a new set
of code. We must override the constructor calls for our class, as the superclass ' Account
' doesn't know about our new interest_rate attribute. </p>

<p>Now that we've created this new subclass, we need to provide an example program to test
and demonstrate the new interest calculation capabilities. For this purpose, I'm using the
demonstration program from </a><a href="../java102/java102.html">Java 102</a> , and have
added an extra call to the ' add_monthly_interest() ' method. </p>

<p>As you can see, the example varies little from its original form in <a href="../java102/java102.html">Java 102</a>, save that we call the interest calculation
function. You may also have noticed that the example calls a <a href="java104.html#default">constructor</a> that doesn't explicitly specify an interest
rate. In this case, our <a href="java104.html#default">constructor</a> uses the default
interest rate of 7.95%. Run this, and you'll see that it does indeed calculate interest
for the account! </p>

<p>For those who would prefer not to have to type (or copy from the clipboard) the code
for this tutorial, I've put together the full source code for this tutorial together as a <a href="java104.zip">ZIP</a>.

</ul>

<p>By now you have learnt some of the basics of Java, and should be able to extend and
modify the examples from the tutorial series. As practice until the next installment of
this tutorial series, you might wish to modify the example to calculate the compound
interest over the course of a year. </p>

<p><b>(Hint - use a standard for loop, calling add_monthly_interest() repeatedly).</b> </p>
