        <P>
          This is a <strong>Public Domain</strong> Java class providing
          <strong>very fast</strong> Base64 encoding and decoding in 
          the form of convenience methods and input/output streams.
        </P>


        <p>
          There are other Base64 utilities on the Internet, some part
          of proprietary packages, some with various open source licenses.
          In any event, I hope with one or more of these Base64 tools, you won't 
          have to write your own like I did.
        </p>
<p>
Thanks to Brian Burton for providing this <a href="Base64Test.java">Base64Test.java</a> test class for use with <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit.org</a>.
</p>

<p>You may view the <a href="api/index.html">Base64 javadoc API</a> online, if you like.</p>

<p><strong>Version 2.3 is not a drop-in replacement</strong> to earlier versions. I finally improved the error handling
such that the code will throw exceptions when there is a problem instead of just quietly returning null. Sorry if you
like the old style (I did too for a long time), but I changed it and think it's better form this way. There are also
some helper methods for encoding data without creating a String object; that should help with very large amounts of
data or when memory is tight.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>
          The easiest way to convert some data is with the convenience methods:
        </p>
<code><pre>String result1 = <strong>Base64.encodeObject</strong>( mySerializableObject );
String result2 = <strong>Base64.encodeBytes</strong>( new byte[]{ 3, 34, 116, 9 } );
</pre></code>   
     
        <p>
          Or you can use the very efficient streams:
        </p>
<code><pre>OutputStream out = <strong>new Base64.OutputStream</strong>( 
                    new FileOutputStream( &quot;out.txt&quot; ) );
// Go on about your outputting...
// ...

InputStream in = <strong>new Base64.InputStream</strong>( 
                  new FileInputStream( &quot;in.txt&quot; ) );
// Go on about your inputting...
// ...
</pre></code>        


        <p>
          There are defaults (OutputStream encodes, InputStream decodes),
          but you can easily override that:
        </p>
<code><pre>OutputStream out = new Base64.OutputStream( 
                    new FileOutputStream( &quot;out.txt&quot; ), <strong>Base64.DECODE</strong> );
// Go on about your outputting...
// ...
</pre></code>    




<h2>A Note About Public Domain</h2>
<p>I have released this software into the Public Domain. That means you can do whatever you want with it. Really. You don't have to match it up with any other open source license &em; just use it. You can rename the files, move the Java packages, whatever you want. If your lawyers say you have to have a license, contact me, and I'll make a special release to you under whatever reasonable license you desire: MIT, BSD, GPL, whatever.</p>



        <h2>Changes</h2>
          <ul>

  <li>v2.3.7 - Fixed subtle bug when base 64 input stream contained the
value 01111111, which is an invalid base 64 character but should not
throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException either. Led to discovery of
mishandling (or potential for better handling) of other bad input
characters. You should now get an IOException if you try decoding
something that has bad characters in it.</li>
<li>v2.3.6 - Fixed bug when breaking lines and the final byte of the encoded
  string ended in the last column; the buffer was not properly shrunk and
  contained an extra (null) byte that made it into the string.</li>
             <li>v2.3.4 - Fixed bug when working with gzipped streams whereby flushing
               the Base64.OutputStream closed the Base64 encoding (by padding with equals
                signs) too soon. Also added an option to suppress the automatic decoding
                of gzipped streams.</li>
              <li>v2.3.3 - Changed default char encoding to US-ASCII which reduces the internal Java
                 footprint with its CharEncoders and so forth. Fixed some javadocs that were
                 inconsistent. Removed imports and specified things like java.io.IOException
                 explicitly inline.</li>
               <li>v2.3.2 - Reduced memory footprint! Finally refined the "guessing" of how big the
                  final encoded data will be so that the code doesn't have to create two output
                  arrays: an oversized initial one and then a final, exact-sized one. Big win
                  when using the <CODE>encodeBytesToBytes(byte[])</CODE> family of methods (and not
                  using the gzip options which uses a different mechanism with streams and stuff).</li>
 <li>v2.3.1 - Added <CODE>encodeBytesToBytes(byte[], int, int, int)</CODE> and some
   similar helper methods to be more efficient with memory by not returning a
   String but just a byte array.</li>
  <li>v2.3 - <strong>This is not a drop-in replacement!</strong> This is two years of comments
   and bug fixes queued up and finally executed. Thanks to everyone who sent
   me stuff, and I'm sorry I wasn't able to distribute your fixes to everyone else.
   Much bad coding was cleaned up including throwing exceptions where necessary 
   instead of returning null values or something similar. Here are some changes
   that may affect you:
   <ul>
    <li><em>Does not break lines, by default.</em> This is to keep in compliance with
      <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3548.html">RFC3548</a>.</li>
    <li><em>Throws exceptions instead of returning null values.</em> Because some operations
      (especially those that may permit the GZIP option) use IO streams, there
      is a possiblity of an java.io.IOException being thrown. After some discussion and
      thought, I've changed the behavior of the methods to throw java.io.IOExceptions
      rather than return null if ever there's an error. I think this is more
      appropriate, though it will require some changes to your code. Sorry,
      it should have been done this way to begin with.</li>
    <li><em>Removed all references to System.out, System.err, and the like.</em>
      Shame on me. All I can say is sorry they were ever there.</li>
    <li><em>Throws NullPointerExceptions and IllegalArgumentExceptions</em> as needed
      such as when passed arrays are null or offsets are invalid.</li>
    <li>Cleaned up as much javadoc as I could to avoid any javadoc warnings.
      This was especially annoying before for people who were thorough in their
      own projects and then had gobs of javadoc warnings on this file.</li>
   </ul>
  <li>v2.2.2 - Fixed encodeFileToFile and decodeFileToFile to use the
   Base64.InputStream class to encode and decode on the fly which uses
   less memory than encoding/decoding an entire file into memory before writing.</li>
   <li>v2.2.1 - Fixed bug using URL_SAFE and ORDERED encodings. Fixed bug
    when using very small files (~< 40 bytes).</li>
   <li>v2.2 - Added some helper methods for encoding/decoding directly from
    one file to the next. Also added a main() method to support command line
    encoding/decoding from one file to the next. Also added these Base64 dialects:
    <ol>
    <li>The default is RFC3548 format.</li>
    <li>Calling Base64.setFormat(Base64.BASE64_FORMAT.URLSAFE_FORMAT) generates
    URL and file name friendly format as described in Section 4 of RFC3548.
    http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3548.html</li>
    <li>Calling Base64.setFormat(Base64.BASE64_FORMAT.ORDERED_FORMAT) generates
    URL and file name friendly format that preserves lexical ordering as described
    in http://www.faqs.org/qa/rfcc-1940.html</li>
    </ol>
    Special thanks to Jim Kellerman at <a href="http://www.powerset.com/">http://www.powerset.com/</a>
    for contributing the new Base64 dialects.
   </li>

<li>v2.1 - Cleaned up javadoc comments and unused variables and methods. Added
    some convenience methods for reading and writing to and from files.</li>
 <li>
  v2.0.2 - Now specifies UTF-8 encoding in places where the code fails on systems
   with other encodings (like EBCDIC).
 </li>
   
   <li>v2.0.1 - Fixed an error when decoding a single byte, that is, when the
     encoded data was a single byte.</li>
   <li>v2.0 - I got rid of methods that used booleans to set options. 
    Now everything is more consolidated and cleaner. The code now detects
    when data that's being decoded is gzip-compressed and will decompress it
    automatically. Generally things are cleaner. You'll probably have to
    change some method calls that you were making to support the new
    options format (<tt>int</tt>s that you &quot;OR&quot; together).</li>

           <li>v1.5.1 - Fixed bug when decompressing and decoding to a
            byte[] using <tt>decode( String s, boolean gzipCompressed )</tt>.
            Added the ability to &quot;suspend&quot; encoding in the Output Stream so
            you can turn on and off the encoding if you need to embed base64
            data in an otherwise &quot;normal&quot; stream (like an XML file).
            <em>This has not been fully tested, so please alert me to bugs.</em></li>
           <li>v1.5 - Output stream pases on flush() command but doesn't do anything itself. This helps when using GZIP streams. Added the ability to <strong>GZip-compress objects</strong> before encoding them.</li>
           <li>v1.4 - Added some helper methods for reading and writing to/from files.</li>
           <li>v1.3.6 - Fixed OutputStream.flush() so that 'position' is reset.</li>
           <li>v1.3.5 - Added flag to turn on and off line breaks. Fixed bug in input stream
               where last buffer being read, if not completely full, was not returned.</li>
           <li>v1.3.4 - Fixed when <em>Improperly padded base64 stream</em> exception
               was incorrectly thrown.</li>
           <li>A bug has been fixed that kept I/O streams from working at all, really.</li>
           <li>A bug has been fixed affecting you if you use the Base64.InputStream
            to encode data.
           </li>
           <li>A bug has been fixed where if you specified an offset when encoding
            an array of bytes, the offset was ignored. 
           </li>
          </ul>
