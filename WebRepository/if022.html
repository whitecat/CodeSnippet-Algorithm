What Version of Java Are You Using?</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom:20px;">
  Multiple copies of Java can be installed on a single computer, and, if you have more than one
  web browser, each one can use a different version of Java, or none at all, so be sure to test
  them all. Below are nine ways to determine the version of Java a web browser is using.<br />
  <span style="font-size:8pt;">Note: The portion of Java that runs programs is referred to as the Java
  Virtual Machine (JVM) or Java Run-time Environment (JRE).</span></p>

<h3>&nbsp;Method 1:&nbsp; Ask Java</h3>
<p>This is my favorite - straight from the horse's mouth (so to speak).
   The Java Run-time Environment is aware of its version and the company that authored it.
   So I wrote a very simple applet (the source code is on the <a href="about.html">About</a> page)
   that gets this information from the JRE and displays it in a pink rectangle.</p>

<div align="center">
<table cellSpacing="0" cellPadding="7" style="width:70%;">
<tr><td align="center" style="background-color:#616EA4; color:white; font-weight:bold; font-size:110%;" >
      The version and vendor from the JRE</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" style="background-color:#D1E3F9; border-left:3px solid #616EA4; border-right:3px solid #616EA4;">
    <applet height="60" alt="Browser has Java disabled" hspace="22" width="440" code="JavaVersionDisplayApplet.class">
    </applet>
  </td></tr>
<tr><td align="center" style="background-color:#E9F0FA; border-left:3px solid #616EA4;
   border-right:3px solid #616EA4; border-bottom:3px solid #616EA4;">
   <p>If Java is working, you will see a pink rectangle above with one line of text that says something like:</p>
   <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">
       Java Version 1.6.0_16 from Sun Microsystems Inc. &nbsp; <i>or</i><br>
       Java Version: 1.3.1 from Apple Computer, Inc.  &nbsp; <i>or</i><br>
       Java Version: 1.1.4 from Microsoft Corp.</font></p>
  </td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<p style="margin-top:24px;">
<b>Troubleshooting: </b>
If you don't see a pink rectangle above, Java may not be installed. Or ZoneAlarm may be blocking the
Java applet/program that displays the pink rectangle. Zone Alarm has a Mobile Code Control feature
that, if set to &quot;Custom&quot;, requires you to first enable mobile code from this web site
(www.javatester.org). Mac users that find that Safari isn't launching Java should see the <a
href="http://forums.macosxhints.com/archive/index.php/t-64807.html">Safari Java broken</a> forum posting at Macoshints.com
regarding the "Open with Rosetta" option (thanks Eliot). In addition, your web browser may have Java disabled.
 See <a href="sampleresults.html">sample results</a>.</p>

     Apple Mac users are often stuck with buggy versions of Java. For whatever reason, Java on the Mac comes from
     Apple. Java on Windows, Linux and Solaris comes from Sun. Apple is always behind the curve, that is, they
     are late in releasing the latest versions of Java for the Mac OSX.<br><br>

  December 3, 2009: Apple issued updates to their versions of Java.
     The latest version of <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3969">Java for OS X 10.6</a> Snow Leopard is 1.6.0_17.
     The latest versions of <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3970">Java for OS X 10.5</a> Leopard  are 1.6.0_17
      and  1.5.0_22. The 1.4.x family of Java has been discontinued.  <br><br>

  September 3, 2009: The latest versions of Java for Leopard and Snow Leopard are
    1.6.0_15, 1.5.0_20 and 1.4.2_22. Tiger users <a
    href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9137502/Apple_patches_critical_Java_bugs_but_leaves_Leopard_users_vulnerable">don't
    get the latest updates</a> and thus are forced to run dangerous, buggy versions of Java (either 1.5.0_19 or 1.4.2_21).<br><br>
  June 15, 2009:  Apple today released a fix for OS X <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3593">10.4</a>
   and <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3581">10.5</a> to the problem described below.
   If you are running OS X 10.4 then the safe versions of Java are 1.5.0_19 and 1.4.2_21 (<a
   href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/Java_for_Mac_OS_X_10_4__Release_9">download here</a>).
   If you are running OS X 10.5, then the safe versions of Java are 1.6.0_13, 1.5.0_19 and 1.4.2_21 (
   <a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/Java_for_Mac_OS_X_10_5_Update_4">download here</a>).<br><br>
 May 20, 2009: All Macs running Java are vulnerable to a security problem with Apple's implementation of Java.
    The only fix <i>was</i> to turn off Java. Macworld has
     <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/140707/disablejava.html">instructions on disabling Java </a>
     in Safari, Firefox,  OmniWeb,  Camino, Opera and iCab.

 As of April 22, 2009, I'm told that the latest version of Java for OS X is 1.6.0_07-b06-153. However, Java 6 is not
     enabled by default even if it is installed. To switch versions, you need to run the utility
     Applications/Utilities/Java/Java Preferences.app This allows you to set the preferred order for selection of a JVM
     (along with various runtime and security options). You can set the order separately for applications and applets.
     Currently Mac users won't have Java 6 unless they enable it manually this way. (thanks Marcus).<br><br>
     As of February 13, 2009, the latest versions of Java for OS X were <a
     href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3436">Java for Mac OS X 10.4 Release 8</a>  and <a
     href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3437">Java for Mac OS X 10.5 Update 3</a>.

 <!--
 Mac OSX: As of August 23, 2007, if you are running Mac OSX there is no safe version of Java according to
    Ryan Naraine of ZDNet. See <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=469&tag=nl.e622">Mac users waiting
    months for ?critical? Java runtime update</a>. The Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) shipped with an old

   If Internet Explorer is using a JVM from Microsoft, you should replace it with
   a newer one from Sun. To un-install the Microsoft JVM see the <a href="installing.html">installing</a>
   page. There is a patch for bugs discovered back in 2005 in the Microsoft JVM (<a

   SA15891</a>) but un-installing it is best.
</div>


<h3 align="center">&nbsp;Method 2: Java command</h3>

<p>In Windows, open a DOS prompt (a.k.a command window) and enter the following command</p>
<p class="cn" style="margin-left:24px;">java -version</p>
<p>The output will look something like:</p>
<p class="cn" style="margin-left:24px;">
java version "1.6.0_03"<br>
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_03-b05)<br>
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.6.0_03-b05, mixed mode, sharing)</p>

<p>You can also use the command &nbsp; &quot;<span class="cn">java -fullversion</span>&quot; &nbsp; and produce output such as:</p>
<p class="cn" style="margin-left:24px;">java full version "1.6.0_03-b05"</p>

<p>On a computer without any version of Java from Sun Microsystems installed, this results in an error message:</p>
<p class="cn" style="margin-left:24px;">
      'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or  batch file.</p>
<p>A computer with only Microsoft's ancient version of Java installed, also produces the above error.</p>

<p>On a Windows machine with multiple versions of Java,
<a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102557-1">according to Sun</a>, this command returns the
default JVM.</p>


<h3 align="center">&nbsp;Method 3:&nbsp; Firefox</h3>

<p>In Firefox version 3, do Tools -> Options -> Main tab -> Manage Add-ons button -> Plug-ins tab.<br>
   The screen shot below shows this from Firefox 3.08 on a Windows XP machine.</p>
   <img src="pix/ff3.javaplugin.png" title="Java plugin in Firefox 3" style="border:2px solid #0357E4; margin-left:26px;">

<p>Another option, in Firefox versions 2 and 3, is to go to the address bar and enter:</p>
<p class="cn" style="margin-left:24px;">about:plugins</p>
<p>If Java is installed there will be multiple Java entries. In Firefox 3 (at least on Windows XP) they are
     labeled &quot;Java(TM) Platform SE x Ux&quot; where the Xs represent version numbers. Back with Firefox 2 they were labeled
     either &quot;Java (TM) Platform&quot; or &quot;Java Plug-in&quot; (last verified with v 2.0.0.12).</p>
<p>On a Windows XP machine with Java version 1.6.0_03 installed, there were <b>seven</b> Java entries, all labelled "Java(TM)
    Platform SE 6 U3" which translates to Version 6, Update 3.
<!-- According to Sun "Java(TM) Plug-in 1.5.0_11-b03" translates  to version 1.5.0_11.</p> -->
<p>Back with version 1 of Firefox, the many Java entries showed different versions of Java.
  For more on how this used to work, see  <a
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/plugin/developer_guide/version.html">Multi-Version Support</a> from Sun.</p>
<!--
removed this in March 2009
<p>I haven't tested with the <b>Mozilla</b> browser in a long time. It used to be that you did Help -&gt; About Plug-ins.
    If Java was not installed, this showed nothing. However, when Java was installed it showed seven different Java plug-in
    entries. Somewhere in these seven entries was the version of Java used by Mozilla.</p>
-->


<h3 align="center">&nbsp;Method 4:&nbsp; Internet Explorer Options</h3>

<p><b>Advanced Options Tab</b></p>
<p>In Internet Explorer 6 and 7 do: &nbsp; <span class="cn">Tools =&gt; Internet Options =&gt; Advanced tab</span>
   &nbsp; and scroll down to about the middle of the options list.  If a version of Java from Sun is installed, there
   will be a section in this list called &quot;Java (Sun)&quot;. If Microsoft's Java is installed, there will be a section in
   this list called &quot;Microsoft VM&quot;. If you see both, as the screen shot below (IE7 on Windows XP SP3) illustrates,
   then IE is using the one that is checked.</p>
<img src="pix/ie7.advancedtab.java.vms.gif" title="Currently used JVM in Internet Explorer 7 on WinXP"
         style="border:2px solid #0357E4; margin-left:26px;">

<p><b>Sun Java Console</b></p>
<p>If a version of Sun's Java is installed, then do:  &nbsp;  <span class="cn">Tools =&gt; Sun Java Console</span>. &nbsp;
   In both IE6 and IE7 this opens a new window that says "Java console" in the blue stripe at the top of the window.
   The first two lines of the window display the version of Sun's Java, a sample is shown below.
   JRE means Java Runtime Environment.<br>
 NOTE: Sometime between Java 1.6.0_07 and 1.6.0_13 Internet Explorer 7 lost the Sun Java Console option under Tools
    on the menu bar (at least under Windows XP). The Java console is available by right clicking on the Java icon
    in the system tray/notification area.</p>
<p class="cn" style="margin-left:24px;">Java Plug-in 1.6.0_07<br>Using JRE version 1.6.0_07 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM</p>


<p><b>Three ActiveX Controls</b></p>
<p>Another IE specific approach is to check the version of the ActiveX control/program that implements Java.</p>
<p>With Internet Explorer 7 do:<br>
     <span class="cn">&nbsp; Tools =&gt; Internet Options =&gt; General tab
     =&gt; Browsing History Settings button =&gt; View Objects button</span><br>
 With Internet Explorer 6 do:<br>
     <span class="cn">&nbsp; Tools =&gt; Internet Options =&gt; General tab
     =&gt; Settings button =&gt; View Objects button</span></p>
<p>This takes you to the folder where the ActiveX controls live. In Windows XP (for both IE6 and IE7) it is:<br>
   <span class="cn">&nbsp;  C:\Windows\Downloaded Program Files</span><br>At this point it gets messy.</p>
<img src="pix/ie7.java.activex.controls.png" title="IE7 Java ActiveX controls"
      style="border:2px solid #808080; margin-left:26px;">
<p>The screen shot above is from IE7 on a Windows XP SP2 machine running Java 1.6.0_07.<ol>
    <li>Why are there three entries?</li>
    <li>Why does each entry have two different version numbers?</li>
    <li>How can anyone translate any of the displayed version numbers into 1.6.0_07?</li>
    <li>Why do the two newer entries have yellow exclamation points?</li>
    <li>Why is the Total Size for each zero?</li></ol>I don't know (repeat five times).</p>
<p>You can right click on an ActiveX control and get its properties. For the most part, the properties display mirrors what
   you see above with two exceptions.<ul>
   <li>Each ActiveX control has a "code base" and for each of the Java entries above the
   code base was<br><span class="cn">http://java.sun.com/update/1.6.0/jinstall-1_6_0_07-windows-i586.cab</span><br>
   Finally, a version number. You may feel like Indiana Jones at this point.<br /><br /></li>
  <li>Each ActiveX control also has a version description. The two entries above with the yellow exclamation
  points have a version description of <i>&quot;Java(TM) Platform SE binary&quot;</i>. But the remaining entry above has
  a version description of <i>&quot;Java&nbsp;Plug-in&nbsp;1.6.0_07&nbsp;for&nbsp;Netscape&nbsp;Navigator&nbsp;(DLL&quot;
  </i>.</li></ul>
 Well, that explains everything.</p>


<h3 align="center">&nbsp;Method 5:&nbsp; jview command</h3>

<p>For the Microsoft JVM, you can get information from the <font face="Courier New">jview</font>
command when entered at a DOS prompt. If you receive an error that no program by
that name exists, then there is no Microsoft JVM on your computer. If output is
displayed, the first line will look something like this:</p>
<p class="cn" style="margin-left:24px;">
    Microsoft (R) Command-line Loader for Java Version 5.00.3802</p>
<p>Microsoft confuses things in that there are two <i>&quot;versions&quot;</i> at play
    here. The  &nbsp;  <span class="cn">jview</span> &nbsp;
 command displays the version of the Microsoft JVM which is independent of the version of
Java that it implements (1.1.4). Microsoft may upgrade their JVM to fix bugs in
the future, and this may result in a new version of their JVM, but it will still
implement the ancient Java version 1.1.4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Versions of the Microsoft JVM are identified by build numbers. The first line
of the <font face="Courier New">jview</font> output has a version number in
x.yy.zzzz format. The final four digits (zzzz) are the version number. On a fairly untouched Windows 98 SE machine,
the version was 5.00.3167. As of
November 2002, the latest version of the Microsoft JVM was 5.00.3805 (see <a href="http://www.scotsnewsletter.com/33.htm">Scot
Finnie's newsletter, October 11, 2002</a>).&nbsp; By December 2002, the
latest version was 5.00.3809. As of April 2003, <b>the latest version is
5.0.3810</b> and, as of July 2005, the latest version is still 3810. Microsoft Knowledge Base
Article - 163637 <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;163637">INFO:
Availability of Current Build of Microsoft VM</a> has more on using the <font face="Courier New">jview</font> command.</p>
<p>Even if Microsoft's JVM is installed on your computer, your web browser may use a different JVM.&nbsp;Sun
Microsystems describes another way to test for the presence of the Microsoft JVM. See
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/uninstall_msvm.xml"> How do I uninstall Microsoft Virtual Machine?</a></p>


<h3 align="center">&nbsp;Method 6: The Java Systray Icon</h3>
<p>If the Java coffee cup is displayed in the System Tray (a.k.a
     Notification area) you can right click on it, select &quot;About Java
     Technology&quot; and get a display that looks like the one shown here (from Windows XP).</p>
<img src="pix/aboutjava6u13.png"  title="Systray: About Java Technology"
   style="margin-bottom:14px; border:2px solid #0357E4;">


<h3 align="center">&nbsp;Method 7: Windows Control Panel</h3>
<p>You can tell which, if any, versions of Sun's Java are installed using the
Windows Control Panel. Note however, that just because Sun's Java is installed,
does not mean that any particular web browser on your computer is using it. In
the Control Panel, select Add/Remove Programs. What to look for in this list of
installed programs varies.</p>
<p>In the old days such as Sun's Java version 1.4.2, the entry here looked like &quot;<font face="Courier New">Java 2 Runtime
    Environment, SE v1.4.2._06</font>&quot;. This meant that
    version 1.4.2_06 is installed on the computer.&nbsp;I hadn't checked this in a
    long time and it has changed for the worse. With Sun's Java version 1.5.0, look for an entry like; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New">&quot;J2SE Runtime Environment 5.0 Update 6&quot;</font>
    <br>Leave it to Sun to confuse this as much as possible. I'll translate:</p><ul>
  <li>&quot;J2SE&quot; means Java</li>
  <li>&quot;Runtime Environment&quot; means JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</li>
  <li>&quot;5.0&quot; means 1.5.0</li>
  <li>&quot;Update 6&quot; refers to the version of version 1.5.0</li></ul>
<p>So, in English it means Sun's Java version 1.5.0_06</p>


<h3 align="center">&nbsp;Method 8:&nbsp; System Information</h3>

<p>In some flavors of Windows, the System Information utility includes
information about Internet Explorer. Among the data displayed is information on
the Java Virtual Machine.&nbsp;
<p>In Windows 2000 you run the System Information utility with:&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System
Tools -&gt; System Information
<p>Double Click on Internet Explorer in the left hand column, then click on
Summary. The Java VM version is displayed. It is similar to the output from the <font face="Courier New">jview</font>
command, but not exactly the same. On one computer <font face="Courier New">jview</font>
displayed 5.00.3809 while the System Information utility displayed 5.0.3809.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>The path to the System Information utility is the same in Windows XP as in
Windows 2000. However, XP does not display Java version information (at least XP
Home Edition SP1 does not).&nbsp;
<p>In Windows 98SE, the path to the System Information utility is also the same
as with Windows 2000. I ran it on two Windows 98SE machines. With a recent
version of IE5, System Information included Internet Explorer information. With
an old version of IE&nbsp; (5.00.2614.3500) it did not.</p>


<h3 align="center">&nbsp;Method 9:&nbsp; Java Console</h3>

<p>For Internet Explorer v6 using Sun's Java:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enable the Java
console with Tools =&gt; Sun Java Console. When the Java Console pops up, the
version number is at the top.&nbsp;</p>


<p>A recent example:</p>


<p><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java Plug-in 1.5.0_10<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using JRE version 1.5.0_10 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User home directory = C:\Documents and
Settings\<i>youruserid</i></font></p>


<p>An old example:</p>


<p>
<font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java(TM) Plug-in: Version 1.4.2_04<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using JRE version 1.4.2_04 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM</font></p>


<p>Additional details, such as the Home Directory where the JVM is installed, are
provided by typing &quot;S&quot; for System Properties.</p>


<hr align="left" width="75%" size="1" color="#99FF99">

<p>When <b> IE5 and IE6 are using Microsoft's Java,</b> you can add the Java console to the View menu by:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools =&gt;
Internet Options =&gt; Advanced tab =&gt; Scroll down to the Microsoft VM section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then turn on the
checkbox for Java console enabled.<br>
Enabling the Java console requires a restart of IE, not of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p> After enabling the Java console, select View =&gt; Java Console. This opens a new
window, the first line of which, has information on the JVM version.&nbsp;This
appears to be the same information reported by the <font face="Courier New">jview</font>
command.&nbsp;Note however that the Java Console will also appear as an option
when you select &quot;View&quot; in Windows Explorer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a machine running IE 6 with all patches applied as of December 2003 under Windows
2000 the output was:&nbsp;
<div align="center"><font face="Courier New" size="2">
     Microsoft (R) VM for Java, 5.0 Release 5.0.0.3810</font></div>
<p> On a machine running IE 5.5 SP2 under Windows 2000, the output was:
<div align="center"><font face="Courier New" size="2">
     Microsoft (R) VM for Java, 5.0 Release 5.0.0.3802</font></div>
<p>On a machine running IE 5.01 SP2 under Windows NT4 the output was:&nbsp;
<div align="center"><font face="Courier New" size="2">
      Microsoft (R) VM for Java, 5.0 Release 5.0.0.3319</font></div>

<p>In <b> Mozilla</b> 1.6, you enable the Java console with Tools =&gt; Web development
=&gt; Java Console.&nbsp;If there is no Java Console option, then Java is not
installed in your copy of Mozilla. When you turn on the Java Console, it
displays the Java version at the top.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Netscape Navigator 4.x</b> can also display the Java console. Click on
&quot;Communicator&quot;, then &quot;Tools&quot;, then &quot;Java Console&quot;.
The first line of the Java console window identifies the vendor and version of
the JVM. Navigator 4.72, 4.78 and 4.8 said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Courier New" size="2">Netscape
Communications Corporation -- Java 1.1.5<br></font>
This works however, only if Java is enabled. With Java disabled, a console
window is not opened.&nbsp;</p>
