<dt><b>Compiler optimizations:</b>
<dd>When you've finished developing and testing your code, recompile with
    compiler optimizations turned on (e.g., <tt><a
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/tools/solaris/javac.html">javac
    -O</a></tt>).  For details on what current Java compilers can do, and how
    you can help them, see <a href="compilers.html">Java compilers</a>. <p>

<dt><b>Just-in-time compilers:</b>
<dd>Make sure your users have a <a
    href="http://www.javacats.com/us/articles/chuckmcmanis091696.html">just-in-time 
    compiler</a> instead of a standard interpreted Java VM.  JIT compilers
    typically improve the performance of non-graphical Java primitives by
    10-30 times (see <a href="benchmarks.html">Java microbenchmarks</a>).
    Browsers with JIT compilers include the Win32 and Mac versions of
    <a href="http://www.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/">Netscape
    Navigator 3.0</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/">Internet
    Explorer 3.0</a>.  Standalone JIT compilers are also available from (at
    least):
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.supercede.com/">Asymetrix</a> (commercial: for
	  Win32).
      <li><a href="http://www.unix.digital.com/products/internet/java.html">DEC</a> 
	  (free: for Digital Unix)
      <li><a href="http://www.hp.com/go/java/">HP</a> (free: for HP-UX).
      <li><a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</a> (free: for x86, Sparc,
	  Alpha, and M68k CPUs).
      <li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualj">Microsoft</a>
	  (free: for Win32).
      <li><a href="http://www.sgi.com/Products/cosmo/">SGI</a> (commercial:

	  Irix</a>).
      <li><a href="http://www.sun.com/workshop/java/">Sun</a> (free: for
	  Win32 and Solaris).
      <li><a href="http://cafe.symantec.com/">Symantec</a> (commercial: for
	  Win32 and MacOS).
    </ul>
    <p>

<dt><b>Exploiting multiprocessors:</b>
<dd>If you have a multiprocessor and a Java VM that can spread threads across
    processors (and currently these are big ifs), you can improve performance
    by multithreading, either manually or through the use of a restructuring
    compiler such as <a
    href="http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/hpjava/">JAVAR</a>. 
    <p>

<dt><b>Native methods:</b>
<dd>If you're don't care about cross-platform portability, <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/books/Series/Tutorial/native/index.html">native
    methods</a> will get you the speed of raw C (or Fortran, or C++, or...).
    <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javatips/jw-javatip13.html">Fallback
    code</a> lets your program continue even if native methods aren't
    available. <p>

<dt><b>Translation into C:</b>
<dd>There are currently four freely-available tools to translate Java into C:
    <a href="http://www.webcity.co.jp/info/andoh/java/j2c.html">j2c</a> from
    Japan,
    <a href="http://www.digiserve.com/nshaylor/jcc.html">JCC</a> from Nik
    Shaylor,
    <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/sumatra/toba/">Toba</a> (formerly
    Juice) from Arizona,
    and <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/EXTERNE/projet/lande/consel/">Harissa</a>
    (formally Salsa) from France.  Toba and Harissa are both products of
    active research groups. 
    <p>

<dt><b>Graphics:</b>
<dd>Use clipping to reduce the amount of work done in <tt>repaint()</tt>,  
    double buffering to improve perceived speed, and image strips or
    compression to speed up downloading times.  <a
    href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-03-1996/jw-03-animation.html">Animation
    in Java Applets</a> from JavaWorld and <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/books/Series/Tutorial/ui/drawing/animation.html">Performing
    Animation</a> from Sun are two good tutorials.  Remember to use
    high-level primitives; it's much faster to call
    <tt>drawPolygon()</tt> on a bunch of points than looping with
    <tt>drawLine()</tt> (tip from <a href="mailto:lugrin@morgan.com">Jean-Marc
    Lugrin</a>).  And if you have to draw a single pixel <tt>drawLine
    (x,y,x,y)</tt> may be faster than <tt>fillRect (x,y,1,1)</tt> (tip from <a
    href="http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~wcochran/">Wayne Cochran</a>). <p>

<dt><b>Input/output:</b>
<dd>Use
    <tt><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.0.2/api/java.io.BufferedInputStream.html">BufferedInputStream</a></tt>
    and <tt><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.0.2/api/java.io.BufferedOutputStream.html">BufferedOutputStream</a></tt> 
    or equivalent buffered methods wherever possible; doing I/O a single byte
    at a time is generally too slow to be practical.  Note that the JDK 1.0.2
    I/O classes use <b>lots</b> of synchronization, so you might get better
    performance by using a single "bulk" call such as readFully and then
    interpreting the data yourself (<a
    href="text/doug_erickson_961119.txt">tip and code</a> from <a
    href="http://www.mech.utah.edu/~erickson">Doug Erickson</a>). <p>

<dt><b>Synchronization:</b>
<dd>In the JDK interpreter, calling a synchronized method is typically 10
    times slower than calling an unsynchronized method.  With JIT
    compilers, this performance gap has increased to 50-100 times (see <a
    href="benchmarks.html">Java microbenchmarks</a>).  Avoid synchronized
    methods if you can -- if you can't, synchronizing on methods rather than
    on code blocks is slightly faster (<a href="text/doug_lea_961121.txt">tip
    and benchmarks</a> from <a href="mailto:dl@altair.cs.oswego.edu">Doug
    Lea</a>). <p>

<dt><b>Exceptions:</b>
<dd>You should only use exceptions where you really need them--not only do
    they have a high basic cost, but their presence can hurt compiler
    analysis (<a href="text/niklas_gustafsson_970221.txt">tip and code</a>
    from Niklas Gustafsson).
    <p>
    
<dt><b>The costs of Strings:</b>
<dd>The String concatenation operator <tt>+</tt> looks innocent but involves a
    lot of work: a new StringBuffer is created, the two arguments are added to
    it with <tt>append()</tt>, and the final result is converted back with a
    <tt>toString()</tt>.  This costs both space and time.  In particular, if
    you're appending more than one String, consider using a StringBuffer
    directly instead (tip from <a href="mailto:marshall@solar.isr.co.jp">Jason
    Marshall</a>, see also space aspects in <a href="size.html">Optimizing for
    Size</a>). <p>

<dt><b>Using API classes:</b>
<dd>Use classes from the 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.0.2/api/">Java API</a> when
    they offer native machine performance that you can't match using Java.
    For example, <tt><a
    href="http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.0.2/api/java.lang.System.html#42763">arraycopy()</a></tt>
    is much faster than using a loop to copy an array of any significant size.
    <p>

<dt><b>Replacing API classes:</b>
<dd>Sometimes API classes do more than you need, with a corresponding increase
    in execution time; for these you can write specialized versions that do
    less but run faster.  For example, in one application where I needed a
    container to store lots of arrays I replaced the original 
    <tt><a href="http://java.sun.com/products/JDK/1.0.2/api/java.util.Vector.html">Vector</a></tt> 
    with a faster dynamic array of objects (see "<a 
    href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~scandal/html-papers/javanesl/">Java as an
    Intermediate Language</a>").  As another example, Paule Houle has produced
    a <a href="http://www.msc.cornell.edu/~houle/RngPack/">set of
    random-number generators</a> that are much faster than
    <tt>Math.random()</tt> (and have quality guarantees too). <p> 

<dt><b>Overriding API methods:</b>
<dd>If you're using a class from the Java API and are seeing performance
    problems with one method, try defining a subclass which overrides that
    method with your own (hopefully more efficient) version. <p>

<dt><b>Avoiding expensive constructs:</b>
<dd>Sometimes Java constructs are so expensive that it can be worth making
    your data structures or code a little more complex to work around the
    problem.  For example, you can add a type id number to objects to avoid
    paying the cost of an <tt>instanceof</tt> (this also allows you to use the
    result in a <tt>switch</tt>).  Similarly, in a long inheritance tree you
    can avoid casting by including a method that returns a value of the type
    you would otherwise cast to (both tips from
    <a href="mailto:GREGM@img.seagatesoftware.com">Greg McClement</a>).

    <p>

<dt><b>Avoiding expensive data structures:</b>
<dd>In a similar manner to the constructs above, expensive Java data
    structures can be replaced with simpler ones at the cost of some extra
    code complexity.  For example, it can be up to twice as expensive to
    access a two-dimensional array as a one-dimensional array, due to the
    extra indirections (tip from <a href="mailto:kerr@wizard.net">Shane
    Kerr</a>).
    <img alt="[NEW]" width=31 height=12 src="new.gif">
    <p>
    
<dt><b>Know your switches:</b> <dd>A <tt>switch</tt> statement is compiled
    into one of <a
href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/html/Compiling.doc.html#4095">two
bytecodes</a>,
    depending on the sparsity of the cases you're switching on.  The first,
    where the numbers are close together, uses a fast direct lookup.  The
    second, where the numbers are further apart, uses a slower search through
    a table.  Look at the bytecode your code is compiled into to find which
    you're using (tip from <a
    href="mailto:GREGM@img.seagatesoftware.com">Greg McClement</a>).  This is
    particularly important if you're trying to replace a sequence of
    <tt>if</tt> statements with a <tt>switch</tt> (tip from <a
    href="emeade@fvh.gtegsc.com">Erik Meade</a>).
    <img alt="[NEW]" width=31 height=12 src="new.gif">
    <p>

<dt><b>Function inlining:</b>
<dd>Java compilers can only inline a method if it is <tt>final</tt>,
    <tt>private</tt>, or <tt>static</tt> (and <a
    href="mailto:eraxhal@era-t.ericsson.se">Hans Hall</a> has noted that
    <tt>javac</tt> will only inline if a method has no local variables).  If
    your code spends lots of time calling a method that has none of these
    modifiers, consider writing a version that is <tt>final</tt>. <p>

<dt><b>Reusing objects:</b>
<dd>It takes a long time to create an object (see <a
    href="benchmarks.html">Java microbenchmarks</a> for exactly how long), so
    it's often worth updating the fields of an old object and reusing it
    rather than creating a new object.  For example, rather than creating a
    new <tt>Font</tt> object in your <tt>paint</tt> method you can declare it
    as an instance object, initialize it once, and then just update it when
    necessary in <tt>paint</tt> (tip from <a
    href="mailto:fmyers@cs.iupui.edu">Frederick Myers</a>).  Similarly, rather
    than allowing the garbage collector to deal with objects you've removed
    from a linked list, you can store them in a free list, to be reused the
    next time you need to add a new object (tip from <a
    href="mailto:GREGM@img.seagatesoftware.com">Greg McClement</a>).  This can
    be particularly important for graphics objects like Rectangles, Points and
    Fonts (tip from <a href="agr@stardiv.de">Alexander Grosse</a>).

<dt><b>High-level optimizations:</b>
<dd>For a higher-level approach to optimizing the structure of object-oriented
    code, the online book
    "<a href="http://g.oswego.edu/dl/oosdw3/">Object-Oriented System
    Development</a>" has a chapter on
