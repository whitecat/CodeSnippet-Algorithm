  <title>Java: Static/Class methods</title>
</head>
<body><div id="content">

<h1 class="title"><a href="../../index.html">Java Notes</a></h1><h1>Static/Class methods</h1>

<p>There are two types of methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Instance methods</b> are associated with an object and 
    use the instance variables of that object.  
    This is the default.
    </li>
<li><b>Static methods</b> use no instance variables of any
    object of the class they are defined in.  
    If you define a method to be static, you will be given a rude 
    message by the compiler if you try to access any instance variables.
    You can access static variables, but except for constants, this is unusual.
    Static methods typically take all they data from
    parameters and compute something from those parameters,
    with no reference to variables.  This is typical of
    methods which do some kind of generic calculation.  A good example
    of this are the many utility methods in the predefined <code>Math</code>
    class. (See <a href="../../summaries/60mathsum.html">Math and java.util.Random</a>).
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Qualifying a static call</h2>
<p>From outside the defining class, an instance method is called by 
prefixing it with an <i>object</i>, which is then passed as an implicit
parameter to the instance method, eg, <code>inputTF.setText("");</code></p>

<p>A static method is called by prefixing it with a <i>class name</i>,
eg, <code>Math.max(i,j);</code>.
Curiously, it can also be qualified with an object, which will be ignored, 
but the class of the object will be used.
</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Here is a typical static method.</p>
<pre class="example">
class MyUtils {
    . . .
    //================================================= mean
    public <span class="hilite">static</span> double mean(int[] p) {
        int sum = 0;  // sum of all the elements
        for (int i=0; i&lt;p.length; i++) {
            sum += p[i];
        }
        return ((double)sum) / p.length;
    }//endmethod mean
    . . .
}
</pre>
<p>The only data this method uses or changes is from parameters
(or local variables of course).</p>


<h2>Why declare a method <code>static</code></h2>
<p>The above <code>mean()</code> method would work just as well if
it wasn't declared <code>static</code>, as long as it was called from 
within the same class.  
If called from outside the class and it wasn't declared static, it would have to be qualified (uselessly) with
an object.  Even when used within the class, there are 
good reasons to define a method as static when it could be.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Documentation</b>.  Anyone seeing that a method is 
    static will know how to call it (see below).
    Similarly, any programmer looking at the code will
    know that a <code>static</code> method can't interact
    with instance variables, which makes reading and  
    debugging easier.
    </li>
<li><b>Efficiency</b>.  A compiler will usually produce
    slightly more efficient code because no implicit
    object parameter has to be passed to the method.
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Calling static methods</h2>
<p>There are two cases.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Called from within the same class</dt>
    <dd>Just write the static method name. Eg,
<pre class="example">
// Called from inside the MyUtils class
double avgAtt = mean(attendance);</pre>
    </dd>

<dt>Called from outside the class</dt>
    <dd>If a method (static or instance) is called from
        another class, something must be given before
        the method name to specify the class where the
        method is defined.  For instance methods, this
        is the object that the method will access. 
        For static methods, the class name should be 
        specified.  Eg,
<pre class="example">
// Called from outside the MyUtils class.
double avgAtt = <span class="hilite">MyUtils.</span>mean(attendance);</pre>
     If an object is specified before it, the object value will be
     ignored and the the class of the object will be used.
   
    </dd>
</dl>


<h2>Accessing static variables</h2>
<p>Altho a <code>static</code> method can't access instance variables,
it can access <code>static</code> variables.  A common use of 
<code>static</code> variables is to define "constants".  
Examples from the Java library are <code>Math.PI</code> or
<code>Color.RED</code>.  They are qualified with the class name,
so you know they are <code>static</code>.
Any method, <code>static</code> or not, can access static variables.
Instance variables can be accessed only by instance methods.
</p>

<h2>Alternate call</h2>
<p>What's a little peculiar, and not recommended, is that an object
   of a class may be used instead of the class name to access
   static methods.  This is bad because it creates the impression
   that some instance variables in the object are used, but this
   isn't the case.
