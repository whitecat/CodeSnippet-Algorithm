<p class="parajust">A typical program uses various values and these values keep
changing while the program is running. For example, you create a program that is
used to perform calculations, the values entered by one user will obviously be
different from the values entered by another user. This also means that, when
creating the program, you cannot know all possible values that will be entered
in your program. You should still be able to manage the values that the users
will eventually enter in your program.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="parajust">If you create a program used to perform calculations as
introduced above, when a user enters a new value that would be involved in the
calculation, to manage that value, you can (temporarily) store it in the
computer memory. Since the values entered in a reserved memory area change
regularly, they are called variables. Because neither you nor the compiler can
predict all possible values that would be used, there are safeguards you can
use. First, you must ask the compiler to reserve an area of memory for a value
you intend to use. Asking the compiler to reserve an area of memory is referred
to as Declaring a Variable. Remember that when you declare a variable, the
compiler reserves an area of the compiler memory for you. Eventually, you can
put the desired but appropriate values in that memory space.</p>
<p class="parajust">After declaring a variable, when you need the value stored
in its memory area, you can ask the compiler to retrieve it and hand it to you.
To effectively handle this transaction, the compiler would need two pieces of
information from you: a name of your choice for the memory area that will be
reserved, and the type of value that will be stored in that area of memory.
Based on this, the formula to declare a variable is:</p>
<pre><i>TypeOfValue</i> <i>VariableName</i></pre>
<p class="parajust">As done in some languages like Pascal or Basic, we will
start with the name.</p>
<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

    <td>
      <p class="subtitle"><a name="Name"></a>The Name of a Variable</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#0000FF" height="1"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="parajust">When you want the compiler to reserve an area of memory for
some values used in your program, you must set a name, also called an
identifier, that will allow you to refer to that area of memory. The name can be
anything of your choice but there are rules you must follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of a variable can be made of one letter (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p,
    q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P,
    Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, or Z) only</li>
  <li>The name of a variable can start with a letter, an underscore &quot;_&quot;,
    or the dollar sign $. The name cannot
    start with a digit. If the name starts with an underscore, the second
    character must be an alphabetical letter</li>
  <li>After the first character, the name of the variable can include letters, digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
    8, or 9), or underscores in any combination</li>
  <li>The name of a variable cannot be one of the words that the Java languages has reserved for its
    own use. A reserved word is also called a keyword. This means that you
    cannot use one of the following keywords to name your variable:<br>

<p class="parajust">Beyond these rules as a foundation, you can add yours. For
example, we will follow suggested standards of the Java documentation. The rules
will follow are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A name will start with a letter in lowercase. Examples are age, f4, name,
    g_14, country</li>
  <li>When a name is a combination of words, only the first name will start in
    lowercase. Examples are firstName, dateOfBirth, pi_314159</li>
  <li>When the name is an abbreviation, we will use uppercase on all characters.
    Examples are EAU, UN, CIA, NSA</li>

<p class="parajust">After declaring a variable, you can store a value in the
memory reserved for it. When you have just declared a variable, it may not hold
a significant value. To know the value it has, you should put an initial value
into that memory space. Putting an initial value is referred to as initializing
the variable.</p>

<p class="parajust">To initialize a variable, on the right side of its name,
type the assignment operator, followed by the value you want to put in the
reserved memory. As we will see in the next few sections, you cannot and should
not put just any type of value in a variable. We will see that there are
different types used for different variables.</p>

<p class="parajust">After declaring a variable and once it has a value, to
display that value, you can provide the name of the variable to the parentheses
(in future lessons, we will learn that this is referred to as passing) of the <b>System.out.print()</b>
method.</p>

<p class="ParaJust">As introduced previously, when declaring a variable, besides
its name, you must provide the type of information that the variable will hold.
The role of this type is to tell the compiler how much memory will be needed to
store the value(s) of that variable. Since your program is not the only one used
in the computer, memory has to be effectively managed.</p>
<p class="ParaJust">The type of value that a variable will hold is called a data
type. As you ay imagine, different variables can be meant to hold different
types of values. Each data type uses a Java keyword to be characterized. As a
modern language, Java provides even more support for its traditional data types.
To do this, a class was created for each data type. This allows you to get more
information from a variable declared with the particular data type you want to
use.</p>

</table>
<p class="parajust">Retrieving a value in Java is not particularly busy. As seen
in our introduction, to do anything, you have to go through a class. To retrieve
a value, you have to go through different classes.</p>
<p class="parajust">When you type a value in a program, to retrieve it, you can
the <b>in</b> object of the <b>System</b> package:</p>
<pre>System.in</pre>
<p class="parajust"><a name="import"></a>After getting that value, you must first store it somewhere.
One of the classes you can use is called <b>Scanner</b>. Before using the
Scanner class, you must import the <b> java.util.Scanner</b> package into your program.
This would be done by writing the following in the top section of the file:</p>
<pre>import java.util.Scanner;</pre>
<p class="parajust">To use the <b>Scanner</b> class to retrieve a value, use the
following formula:</p>
<pre>Scanner <i>VariableName</i> = new Scanner(System.in);</pre>
<p class="parajust">The only think we need to mention at this time is that,
after the <b>Scanner</b> class, you must give a variable name. An example would
be:</p>
<pre>Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);</pre>
<p class="parajust">The other details, such as why <b>System.in</b> is written
in the parentheses after <b>new Scanner</b>, will be explained in future
lessons.</p>
<p class="parajust">After declaring a <b>Scanner</b> class, its variable is
ready to receive the value. The value depends on a type. We will see in the next
lessons. When getting a value, the Scanner class must be able to convert it to
its appropriate type. To support this, the <b>Scanner</b> class is equipped with
a mechanism (actually called a method) for each type of value. To retrieve a
value, you will write the name of the Scanner variable, followed by a period,
followed by the mechanism as we will indicate, then assign it to the variable
whose value you want to retrieve. The formula will be:</p>
<pre><i>VariableName</i> = <i>ScannerVariable</i>.<i>Mechanism</i>();</pre>
<p class="parajust">&nbsp;Notice the parentheses and the semi-colon.</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p class="subtitle">Data Output</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#0000FF" height="1"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="parajust">To display a value, you can write it in the
      parentheses of <b>System.out.print()</b>. If the value is a character,
include it between single-quotes. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print(<font color="#FF0000">'Q'</font>);
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>
<pre>Q</pre>
<p class="parajust">If the value is a word or a sentence, include it between
double-quotes. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print(<font color="#FF0000">&quot;James Harding&quot;</font>);
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>
<pre>James Harding</pre>
<p class="parajust">If the value is a (constant) number, simply type that number
in the parentheses of <b>System.out.print()</b> or <b>System.out.println()</b>.
Here is an example:</p>
<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print(<font color="#FF0000">248</font>);
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>
<pre>248</pre>
<p class="parajust">If the value is stored in a variable, you can write the name
of that variable in the parentheses of <b>System.out.print()</b>. We will see
various examples in the next sections.</p>
<p class="parajust">Instead of a constant value in the parentheses of <b>System.out.print()</b>
or <b>System.out.println()</b>, you may want to add other items, such as a
sentence that is made of words and values that would come from variables.
Fortunately, you have many options. If you want to exercise some control as to
how a value is formatted, instead of using <b>System.out.print()</b> or <b>System.out.println()</b>,
use <b>System.out.printf()</b>. This allows you to format how data should appear
when displayed to the user. Data types are divided in categories:
characters, integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. To display a
particular type, you type the percent operator ?%?, followed by the category
of data. The basic formula to follow is:</p>
<pre>System.out.printf(&quot;<i>blah blah blah</i> %<i>Character</i> <i>blah blah</i>&quot;, <i>variable</i>);</pre>
<p class="parajust">Any <i>blah</i> represents anything word or sentence you
want to include in the display. At some point, you will write % followed by a
character. We will see the examples in the appropriate section. The first
section ends with a closing double-quote followed by a comma. After the comma,
you must include the name of the variable whose value will be displayed in the <i>Character</i>
placeholder.</p>
<p class="parajust">Instead of one value, you can create as many placeholders as
you want. The formula to follow is:</p>
<pre>System.out.printf(&quot;<i>blah </i>%<i>Char1 blah </i>%<i>Char1 blah </i>%<i>Char1 blah</i>&quot;, <i>var1, var2, var3</i>);</pre>
<p class="parajust">Once again, you will replace each <i>blah</i> with whatever
you want to add as part of your sentence. Each <i>Char</i> is a placeholder for
a character as we will see in various examples. After the comma, you must
include a variable name (or a value) for each <i>Char</i> placeholder, in the
order they appear in the double-quotes, no more, no less.</p>

      <p class="parajust">A string is one or more characters considered as a
      single value. Everything entered in a program, requested from the user, or
      displayed as a series of characters is primarily a string. To support
      strings, Java is equipped with the <b> String</b> class. To declare a variable
      that would hold a string, use the <b> String</b> data type.</p>
<p class="parajust">To retrieve a string, you can apply <b> next()</b>
to your <b>Scanner</b> class. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
        String firstName;
        
        System.out.print(&quot;Enter the First Name: &quot;);
        <font color="#FF0000">firstName = scnr.next();
</font>
        System.out.print(&quot;First Name: &quot;);
        System.out.print(firstName);
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">Here is an example of running the program:</p>
<pre>Enter the First Name: James
First Name: James</pre>

<p class="parajust"><b>next()</b> is used to get only one word that is considered
terminated by an empty space. To retrieve a string made of different words, you
must assume that it would be terminated by a new line. To get such a string, use <b>nextLine()</b>.</p>
      <p class="parajust"> To initialize a <b>String</b>
      variable, assign it a double-quoted value. Here is an example:</p>
      <pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        <font color="#FF0000">String firstName = &quot;Johua&quot;;</font>
    }
}</pre>

      <p class="parajust">To display the value of a string, you can pass the
      name of variable to the <b>System.out.print()</b>
method. Here is an example:</p>
      <pre>public class Exercise {

    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        String firstName = &quot;Johua&quot;;
        
        System.out.print(&quot;First Name: &quot;);
        <font color="#FF0000">System.out.print(firstName);</font>
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">As an alternative, to display a string using <b>System.out.printf()</b>,
add a <b>%s</b> expression in the double-quotes ass the placeholder of the
variable.
Here is an example:</p>
<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	String fullName = &quot;Patricia Katts&quot;;

        System.out.printf(&quot;Full Name: <font color="#FF0000">%s</font>&quot;, <font color="#FF0000">fullName</font>);
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>
<pre>Full Name: Patricia Katts</pre>

<p class="parajust">An escape sequence is a special character that displays 
non-visibly. For example, you can use this type of character to indicate the end 
of line, that is, to ask the program to continue on the next line. An escape 
sequence is represented by a backslash character, \, followed by another 
character or symbol. For example, the escape sequence that moves to the next 
line is \n.</p>
<p class="parajust">An escape can be included in single-quotes as in '\n', in
double-quotes as &quot;\n&quot;, or as part of a string.</p>

      <p class="parajust">We mentioned that any character or group of characters
      is a string. To make it easy to manage strings, you can
      &quot;concatenate&quot; one string with another to create a new string.
      The concatenation is done by adding one string to another, which is done
      using the addition operator. Here is an example:</p>
      <pre>public class Exercise {

    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        String firstName = &quot;Johua &quot;;
        String lastName  = &quot;Yacomo&quot;;
        <font color="#FF0000">String fullName  = firstName + lastName;</font>
        
        System.out.print(&quot;Full Name: &quot;);
        System.out.print(fullName);
    }
}</pre>
      <p class="parajust">In the same way, you can concatenate as many strings
      as you want, using the addition operator the same way you would in
      algebra. When writing <b>System.out.print(</b>&quot;First Name: &quot;<b>);</b>,
      the First Name value is a string. This allows you to also add strings
      locally where they are used, such as in the print() method. Here is an
      example:</p>
      <pre>public class Exercise {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String firstName = &quot;Johua&quot;;
        String strSeparator = &quot;, &quot;;
        String lastName  = &quot;Yacomo&quot;;
        
        <font color="#FF0000">System.out.print(&quot;Full Name: &quot; + lastName + strSeparator + firstName);</font>

      <p class="parajust">A number is referred to as natural when it mainly
      contains digits. Examples are 2, 485, or 182976389. When a natural number
      doesn't include a sign like these ones, it is referred to as unsigned.
      That number is also consider positive, that is, above 0. A natural number
      can have a value under 0. Such a value is referred as a negative. To
      identify a number as negative, you must type the minus symbol
      &quot;-&quot; to its left. An example is -246.</p>

      <p class="parajust">In everyday writing, when a number is too long to
      read, such as 182976389, you can use a special symbol to separate the
      thousands. In US English, this number is the comma. An example would be
      182,976,389. This makes it easy to read. This writing is allowed in
      various scenarios but you must never use it in your Java programs.</p>

      <p class="parajust">A byte is
      series of 8 bits. It is used to represent small numbers. To declare
      a variable that would hold a natural number between -128 and 127, you can
      use the <b>byte</b> data type.</p>
<p class="parajust">To retrieve the value of a byte variable, apply <b>nextByte()</b> to the <b>Scanner</b>
variable. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);
        byte temperature;

        System.out.print(&quot;Temperature: &quot;);
        System.out.println(temperature);
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">Here is an example of running the program:</p>
<pre>Enter the temperature: 32
Temperature: 32</pre>

<p class="parajust"> To initialize a byte variable, make sure
      you assign it a number in the appropriate range. Here is an example:</p>
      <pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        <font color="#FF0000">byte temperature = -28;</font>
        System.out.print(&quot;Temperature: &quot;);
        System.out.println(temperature);
    }  
}</pre>
      <p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>
      <pre>Temperature: -28</pre>
      <p class="parajust">The value assigned to a byte variable must in the
      correct range, otherwise you would receive an error. For example, if you
      assign a value lower than -128 or higher than 127 to a byte variable, the
      program would not work.</p>
<p class="parajust">In the parentheses of <b>System.out.print()</b> or <b>System.out.println()</b>,
you can concatenate a string a byte variable. To do this, us the + operator
between them. Here is an example:</p>
      <pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        byte temperature = -28;
        System.out.println(<font color="#FF0000">&quot;Temperature: &quot; + temperature</font>);

      <p class="parajust">The word integer is also used for a natural number. An
      integer is simply a natural number. Many, if not most, languages provide
      different data types for various categories of integers. In Java, an
      integer is variable whose values are between -2,147,483,648 and
      2,147,484,647. The value is also said to fit in a 32-bit range. To declare
      a variable that would hold numbers of that range, use the <b> int</b> keyword.</p>
<p class="parajust">To retrieve the value a variable of type <b> int</b>, apply <b>nextInt()</b>
to the <b>Scanner</b> variable. Here is an example:</p>

        <font color="#FF0000">int days = 468;</font>
        System.out.print(&quot;Days Passed: &quot;);
        System.out.println(days);

        System.out.print(<font color="#FF0000">&quot;Days Passed: &quot; + days</font>);
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">Instead of a normal decimal number, you can initialize an
int variable with a hexadecimal number. The number must be preceded with 0x.
      Here is an example:</p>
      <pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        <font color="#FF0000">int number = 0xA2EE;</font>
        System.out.print(&quot;Number: &quot; + number);

<p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>
<pre>Number: 41710</pre>
<p class="parajust">To display the value of an <b>int</b> variable using<b>

Here is an example:</p>
<pre>public class Exercise {

      <p class="parajust">An integer is referred to as short if its value is
      between -32768 and 32767. This number can fit in 16 bits. To declare a
      variable that would hold numbers in that range, you can use the <b>short</b>
      data type.</p>
<p class="parajust">To
retrieve a short integer, apply <b>nextShort()</b> to the <b> Scanner</b> variable.
Here is an example:</p>

<pre>import java.util.Scanner;

        System.out.print(&quot;Number of Students: &quot;);
        System.out.println(numberOfStudents);
    }

        System.out.println(numberOfStudents);
    }
}</pre>
      <p class="parajust">As you may realize, any number that can fit in a short
      can also fit in an integer. In order words, you can safely use the <b> int</b>
      keyword to declare a variable that would hold numbers intended for a
      short. There is no danger. Even if you think of computer memory (because a
      <b>short</b> uses less space than an <b>int</b>), memory is not expensive
      anymore.</p>

<p class="parajust">You can concatenate a string a short variable in the
parentheses of <b>System.out.print()</b> or <b>System.out.println()</b>. To do
this, use the + operator. Here is an example:<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        short numberOfStudents = 3428;
        System.out.print(<font color="#FF0000">&quot;Number of Students: &quot; + numberOfStudents</font>);
    }
}</pre>
      <p class="parajust">Just as mentioned for the byte, the value you assigned
      to a <b>short</b> variable must fit in the allowed range, otherwise you

      accurately. To declare a variable for such a number, use the <b> long</b> keyword.</p>
<p class="parajust">To

        System.out.print(<font color="#FF0000">&quot;Distance: &quot; + distance</font>);
    }
}</pre>

<p class="parajust">You can also initialize a long variable with a hexadecimal
number. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        <font color="#FF0000">long number = 0xACE882;</font>
        System.out.print(&quot;Number: &quot; + number);
    }
}</pre>

<p class="parajust">To display the v alue of a <b>long</b> variable using <b>System.out.printf()</b>, use the
<b>%d</b> expression.
Here is an example:</p>
<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long number = 30208;
        System.out.printf(&quot;Number: <font color="#FF0000">%d</font>&quot;, + number);
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">If you want the result to appear as a hexadecimal number,
use <b>%x</b> or <b>%X</b>.</p>
      <p class="parajust">As you may realize, a number that fits in a <b>short</b>
      or an <b>int</b> can also fit in a <b>long</b>. This means that you can
      declare a variable as <b>long</b> but store very small numbers in its
      memory. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        <font color="#FF0000">long days = 24;</font>
        System.out.print(&quot;Days: &quot; + days);
    }
}</pre>
      <p class="parajust">This program works perfectly fine but may result in a
      significant waste of memory. When you declare a long variable, by default,
      the compiler &quot;allocates&quot; only enough memory for an integer so
      there would not be a waste. In some cases, you may want the compiler to
      use 64 bits for your <b>long</b> variable. Consider the following program:</p>

      <pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        <font color="#FF0000">long days = 245885475475;</font>
        System.out.print(&quot;Days: &quot; + days);
    }
}</pre>
      <p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>
      <pre>init:
deps-jar:
Compiling 1 source file to C:\Programs\JavaLessons\Exercise1\build\classes
C:\Programs\JavaLessons\Exercise1\src\exercise1\Main.java:24: 
integer number too large: 245885475475
        long days = 245885475475;
1 error
BUILD FAILED (total time: 0 seconds)</pre>
      <p class="parajust">The program would not work because the compiler would
      have reserved space for an integer but the assigned value needs more room.
      If you insist on using enough memory for a <b>long</b> integer, when
      initializing it, on the right side of the value, type <b>L</b>. Here is an
      example:</p>

<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long days = 245885475475<font color="#FF0000">L</font>;
        System.out.print(&quot;Days: &quot;);
        System.out.print(days);
    }
}</pre>
      <p class="parajust">This time, the program works fine because the compiler
      was explicitly asked to reserve enough memory.

<p class="parajust">A number is referred to as
      decimal when it displays a natural section and a precision. Both sections
      are separated by a special character called the decimal symbol, which
      depends on the language and can be verified in the Regional Options dialog
      box from the Control Panel:</p>
      
      
      <p class="pcenter"><img border="0" src="../dlgboxes/decimal1.gif" width="404" height="485" alt="Decimal"></p>
      
      <p class="parajust">The values on both sides of the decimal symbol are
      represented by digits. The value on the left side is expressed like a
      natural number: it can use a positive (+) or a negative (-) sign to show
      whether it is higher or lower than 0. It can also be written with commas
      to make it easier to read. The value on the right side of the decimal
      separator can be made of only digits. This value specify the level of
      precision allowed on the number. Normally, the more numbers, the more
      precise.</p>
      
      <p class="parajust">The Java language supports two types of real numbers:
      single precision and double-precision.</p>

      <p class="subtitle"><a name="double"></a>Double-Precision Values</p>

    <td bgcolor="#0000FF" height="1"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
      <p class="parajust">One of the main concerns with decimal values used in
      mathematics is their level of accuracy: the number needs to be as precise
      as possible. To declare a variable used to hold such a decimal number, you
      can use the <b> double</b> keyword.</p>

      <p class="parajust">To retrieve a double-precision value, you apply <b>nextDouble</b>
      to your <b>Scanner</b> variable.</p>

<p class="parajust">To initialize a double variable, assign a decimal number to
it. Here is an example:</p>

      <pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        <font color="#FF0000">double PI = 3.14159;</font>
        System.out.print(&quot;PI: &quot;);
        System.out.print(PI);
    }
}</pre>
      <p class="parajust">To ensure its accuracy, a double variable usually uses
      64 bits to store its value.</p>

<p class="parajust">In the parentheses of <b>System.out.print()</b> or <b>System.out.println()</b>,
you can concatenate a string with a <b>double</b> variable. This is done using
the + operator. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double number = 2685.404;
        System.out.print(<font color="#FF0000">&quot;Number: &quot; + </font>number );
    }
}</pre>

<p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>

<pre>Number: 2685.404</pre>

<p class="parajust">You can also initialize a long variable with a hexadecimal
number. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        <font color="#FF0000">double number = 0xDDF402;</font>
        System.out.print(&quot;Number: &quot; + number );
    }
}</pre>

<p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>
<pre>Number: 1.4545922E7</pre>
<p class="parajust">To display the v alue of a double variable using <b>System.out.printf()</b>,
you have various options. You can use <b>%g</b> or <b>%G</b>. The compiler would
use what is referred to as the general fixed number formal, which in US English
uses two digits after the decimal separator. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double number = 2685.404;
        System.out.printf(&quot;Number: <font color="#FF0000">%g</font>&quot;, number );
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>
<pre>Number: 2685.40</pre>
<p class="parajust">As an alternative, you can use the <b>%f</b> expression. If
this case, the compiler would use a fixed standard format.
Here is an example:</p>
<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double number = 2685.404;
        System.out.printf(&quot;Number: <font color="#FF0000">%f</font>&quot;, number );
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>
<pre>Number: 2685.404000</pre>
<p class="parajust">As you can see, the compiler would decide how many digits to
display after the decimal separator, which is the period in US English. If you
want to specify how many digits to display after the decimal separator, use an
expression that follows this format:</p>
<pre>%.<i>Number</i>f </pre>
<p class="parajust">Notice the period after the % symbol. Between the period and
f, you use the Number placeholder to enter the desired number of digits. Here is
an example:</p>
<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double number = 2685.404;
        System.out.printf(&quot;Number: <font color="#FF0000">%.8f</font>&quot;, number );
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">In this example, we used 8. This indicates to the compiler
that we want to see 8 placeholders for digits after the decimal separator. In
this case, there would be 8 placeholders. If the number includes 8 or more
digits after the decimal separators, they would be displayed. If there are less
than 8, there would be 0s in the remaining placeholder. The above code would
produce:</p>
<pre>Number: 2685.40400000</pre>
<p class="parajust">If you want to display the number in scientific (exponential)
format, use %e or %E. Here is an example:</p>
<pre>public class Exercise {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double number = 2685.404;
        System.out.printf(&quot;Number: <font color="#FF0000">%e</font>&quot;, number );
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">This would produce:</p>
<pre>Number: 2.685404e+03</pre>
<p class="parajust">As you can see, the number appears with e. If you want the E
(uppercase), use %E.</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#0000FF" height="1"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
      <p class="parajust">A real number qualifies as single-precision when it
      needs only a limited number of bits, typically half of what is needed for
      a double, to show its value. The value typically
      fits in 32 bits and the precision is not a significant factor. To declare
      a variable that would hold decimal values with little to no concern with
      precision, you can use the <b> float</b> data type.</p>

<p class="parajust">To
retrieve a <b>float</b> value, apply <b>nextFloat</b> to your <b>Scanner</b>
variable.</p>

      <p class="parajust">Because accuracy and precision are an important factor
      in mathematics, by default, when you declare a variable as <b>float</b>, you must
      explicitly let the compiler know that you are not concerned with precision
      and that the value would be dealt with single-precision. To specify this,
      when initializing the variable, type <b> F</b> to the left of the value. Here is
      an example:</p>

      <pre>public class Exercise {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        <font color="#FF0000">float PI = 3.14F;</font>
        System.out.print(&quot;PI: &quot;);
        System.out.print(PI);
    }
}</pre>
      <p class="parajust">In the same way, when declaring a double-precision
      variable, to reinforce the idea of its values requiring double-precision,
      type <b> d</b> or <b> D</b> to the right side of its value. This would be done as follows:</p>

      <pre>public class Exercise {

    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        double PI = 3.14159<font color="#FF0000">D;</font>
        System.out.print(&quot;PI: &quot;);
        System.out.print(PI);
    }
}</pre>
<p class="parajust">Although a <b>double</b> variable uses more memory
      than the average variable, because memory is not expensive anymore, you
should usually use the <b>double</b> data type more than the <b>float</b>
      when declaring a variable for a decimal value. Use <b>float</b> only if you must.</p>


<p class="parajust">The float follows the same rules as the double regarding
concatenation, hexadecimal, or formatting with <b>System.out.printf()</b>.</p>

      <p class="parajust">When introducing natural numbers, we saw that you
      could use the byte data type to declare a variable that would hold small
      numbers. Actually the value used for a <b> byte</b> variable represents code for a
      character. The character is internally recognized by
      its ASCII number. For this reason, you can use the <b> byte</b> data type to
      declare a variable that would be used to hold a single character. To initialize
      such a variable, assign a single-quoted
      character to it. Here is an example:</p>
      <pre>public class Exercise {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        <font color="#FF0000">byte driversLicenseClass = 'M';</font>
    }
}</pre>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#0000FF" height="1"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
      <p class="parajust">If you use the <b> byte</b> data type to represent a
      character, the compiler would use only 8 bits (actually 7) for the
      character. When this was conceived, it didn't take into consideration
      international characters of languages other than English. To support
      characters that are not traditionally used in (US) English, another
      character format was created: Unicode. This includes Latin-based and
      non-Latin-based languages.</p>
      <p class="parajust">To support Unicode characters, Java provides the <b>char</b>
      data type. Based on this, to declare a variable that would be used to
      store characters, use the <b>char</b> keyword. To initialize the variable,
      assign it a single-quoted character. Here is an example:</p>
      <pre>public class Exercise {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {        
        <font color="#FF0000">char driversLicenseClass = 'C';</font>
        
        System.out.print(&quot;Driver's License Class: &quot;);
        System.out.print(driversLicenseClass);
    }
}</pre>

<p class="parajust">To display a character using <b>System.out.printf()</b>, use the %c format.</p>
