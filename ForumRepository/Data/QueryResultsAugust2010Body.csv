<p>I am using the async version of Google Analytics along with custom variables and events. I have placed the tracking script (cut and paste from google) at the end of the  section. </p>

<p>The custom variable is set above the tracking code in the head section. I'm assuming that Googles Analytics will send the data including the custom variable on page load. What happens if I have onclick triggered events? Will the custom variable in the head section get sent along with each event that is triggered as well?</p>

<p>I'm not sure how this plays out with javascript.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I'm trying to build a "simple" web app that calculates either a male or females body fat % based on the U.S. Navy's circumference formula.  I have the majority of the app completed at this point.  However, I cannot figure out why the way I've setup the formula below won't work.  Two of the values are underlined in red in my .cs file.</p>

<p><strong>My Formula:</strong></p>

<pre><code>TBBodyFat.Text = Convert.ToString(495 / (1.0324-.19077(Math.Log(Convert.ToDouble(TBWaist.Text)-Convert.ToDouble(TBNeck.Text)))+.15456(Math.Log(Convert.ToDouble(TBHeight.Text)))));  
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Original Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>%Fat=495/(1.0324-.19077(log(abdomen-neck))+.15456(log(height)))-450       
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Pop-Up for the two underlined values (.19077 and .15456):</strong></p>

<p>When I save an apartment record in rails, for some reason it is updating the updated_on field <em>and</em> the created_on field. I can't figure out how/why the created_on field is being updated.</p>

<p>To try and debug the situation, I opened up a console window and did the following</p>

<pre><code>t = Apartment.find(11619)
t.beds = 4
t.save
</code></pre>

<p>When I check my log file, I see the following</p>

<pre><code>   SQL (0.0ms)   BEGIN
   Apartment Load (0.0ms)   SELECT `apartments`.id FROM `apartments` WHERE (`apartments`.`unit_num` = BINARY '2005' AND `apartments`.building_id = 17755 AND `apartments`.id &lt;&gt; 11619) LIMIT 1
   Apartment Load (0.0ms)   SELECT * FROM `apartments` WHERE (`apartments`.`id` = 11619) 
   Apartment Update (0.0ms)   UPDATE `apartments` SET `beds` = 4.0, `updated_on` = '2010-07-31 19:54:10' WHERE `id` = 11619
   SQL (0.0ms)   COMMIT
</code></pre>

<p>This shows only the updated_on field being changed!</p>

<p>So I guess the question is, what could change my created_on value and yet not show up in the rails log file?</p>

<p>EDIT: I know the created_on field is changing because when I do a sql query to check, the value has been updated to be the same as the updated_on field. Also, I display the created_on value to my users, which is what brought this bug to my attention.</p>

<p>EDIT2: The table definition is as follows. I seemed to have solved my problem by changing the default value from "CURRENT_TIMESTAMP" to "0000-00-00 00:00:00", though I don't understand why this would make a difference?</p>

<p>"Stripping" the GIF of animation can be done by converting it to another format and then back again. PNG is a good candidate for this "other format", since it is non-lossy, unlike JPEG. Using PHPs GD functions, and outputting a PNG instead of a GIF:</p>

<pre><code>header('Content-type: image/png');
imagepng(imagecreatefromgif($file));
</code></pre>

<p>This might work (haven't tested) if PHP/GD doesn't support animated GIFs (I don't think it does); and it will output the image in GIF format, unlike the above snippet:</p>

<pre><code>header('Content-type: image/gif');
imagegif(imagecreatefromgif($file));
</code></pre>

<p>If that won't work, and output in GIF format is essential, this will:</p>

<pre><code>$img1 = imagecreatefromgif($file);
$size = getimagesize($img1);
$img2 = imagecreatetruecolor($size[0], $size[1]);
imagecopy($img2, $img1, 0, 0, 0, 0, $size[0], $size[1]);
header('Content-type: image/gif');
imagegif($img2);

<p>Caveat lector: I've never done this. The following is a rough sketch of what I'd try.</p>

<p>You will need to use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/c-api/unicode.html#PyUnicode_AsUnicode" rel="nofollow">PyUnicode_AsUnicode</a> function and the next one, PyUnicode_GetSize. In declarations, where you currently have <code>char</code>, use <a href="http://docs.python.org/c-api/unicode.html#Py_UNICODE" rel="nofollow">Py_UNICODE</a> instead. Presumably with a narrow (UCS2) build you will copy the internal structure, converting surrogate pairs as you go. With a wide (UCS4) build you might operate directly on the internal structure.</p>

<p>Ok, I've been figuring this out since I originally asked the question, and I finally have a solution that does just what I want.  A bit of up front explanation is due, however.  IHttpHandler is a very basic interface:</p>

<pre><code>bool IsReusable { get; }
void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
</code></pre>

<p>There is no built in property for accessing the route data, and the route data also can't be found in the context or the request.  A <code>System.Web.UI.Page</code> object has a <code>RouteData</code> property , <code>ServiceRoute</code>s do all the work of interpreting your UriTemplates and passing the values to the correct method internally, and ASP.NET MVC provides its own way of accessing the route data.  Even if you had a <code>RouteBase</code> that (a) determined if the incoming url was a match for your route and (b) parsed the url to extract all of the individual values to be used from within your IHttpHandler, there's no easy way to pass that route data to your IHttpHandler.  If you want to keep your IHttpHandler "pure", so to speak, it takes responsibility for dealing with the url, and how to extract any values from it.  The RouteBase implementation in this case is only used to determine if your IHttpHandler should be used at all.</p>

<p>One problem remains, however.  Once the RouteBase determines that the incoming url is a match for your route, it passes off to an IRouteHandler, which creates the instances of the IHttpHandler you want to handle your request.  But, once you're in your IHttpHandler, the value of <code>context.Request.CurrentExecutionFilePath</code> is misleading.  It's the url that came from the client, minus the query string.  So it's not the path to your .ashx file.  And, any parts of your route that are constant (such as the name of the method) will be part of that execution file path value.  This can be a problem if you use UriTemplates within your IHttpHandler to determine which specific method within your IHttpHandler should handing the request.</p>

<p>Example:  If you had a .ashx handler at /myApp/services/myHelloWorldHandler.ashx
And you had this route that mapped to the handler: "services/hello/{name}"
And you navigated to this url, trying to call the <code>SayHello(string name)</code> method of your handler:
<a href="http://localhost/myApp/services/hello/SayHello/Sam" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/myApp/services/hello/SayHello/Sam</a></p>

<p>Then your <code>CurrentExecutionFilePath</code> would be: /myApp/services/hello/Sam.  It includes parts of the route url, which is a problem.  You want the execution file path to match your route url.  The below implementations of <code>RouteBase</code> and <code>IRouteHandler</code> deal with this problem.</p>

<p>Before I paste the 2 classes, here's a very simple usage example.  Note that these implementations of RouteBase and IRouteHandler will actually work for IHttpHandlers that don't even have a .ashx file, which is pretty convenient.</p>

<pre><code>// A "headless" IHttpHandler route (no .ashx file required)
RouteTable.Routes.Add(new GenericHandlerRoute&lt;HeadlessService&gt;("services/headless"));
</code></pre>

<p>That will cause all incoming urls that match the "services/headless" route to be handed off to a new instance of the <code>HeadlessService</code> IHttpHandler (HeadlessService is just an example in this case.  It would be whatever IHttpHandler implementation you wanted to pass off to).</p>

<p>Ok, so here are the routing class implementations, comments and all:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;

public class GenericHandlerRoute&lt;T&gt; : RouteBase where T : IHttpHandler, new()
{
    public string RouteUrl { get; set; }


    public GenericHandlerRoute(string routeUrl)
    {
        RouteUrl = routeUrl;
    }


    public override RouteData GetRouteData(HttpContextBase httpContext)
    {
        // See if the current request matches this route's url
        string baseUrl = httpContext.Request.CurrentExecutionFilePath;
        int ix = baseUrl.IndexOf(RouteUrl);
        if (ix == -1)
            // Doesn't match this route.  Returning null indicates to the asp.net runtime that this route doesn't apply for the current request.
            return null;

        baseUrl = baseUrl.Substring(0, ix + RouteUrl.Length);

        // This is kind of a hack.  There's no way to access the route data (or even the route url) from an IHttpHandler (which has a very basic interface).
        // We need to store the "base" url somewhere, including parts of the route url that are constant, like maybe the name of a method, etc.
        // For instance, if the route url "myService/myMethod/{myArg}", and the request url were "http://localhost/myApp/myService/myMethod/argValue",
        // the "current execution path" would include the "myServer/myMethod" as part of the url, which is incorrect (and it will prevent your UriTemplates from matching).
        // Since at this point in the exectuion, we know the route url, we can calculate the true base url (excluding all parts of the route url).
        // This means that any IHttpHandlers that use this routing mechanism will have to look for the "__baseUrl" item in the HttpContext.Current.Items bag.
        // TODO: Another way to solve this would be to create a subclass of IHttpHandler that has a BaseUrl property that can be set, and only let this route handler
        // work with instances of the subclass.  Perhaps I can just have RestHttpHandler have that property.  My reticence is that it would be nice to have a generic
        // route handler that works for any "plain ol" IHttpHandler (even though in this case, you have to use the "global" base url that's stored in HttpContext.Current.Items...)
        // Oh well.  At least this works for now.
        httpContext.Items["__baseUrl"] = baseUrl;

        GenericHandlerRouteHandler&lt;T&gt; routeHandler = new GenericHandlerRouteHandler&lt;T&gt;();
        RouteData rdata = new RouteData(this, routeHandler);

        return rdata;

    {
        // This route entry doesn't generate outbound Urls.

</code></pre>

<p>I know this answer has been quite long winded, but it was not an easy problem to solve.  The core logic was easy enough, the trick was to somehow make your IHttpHandler aware of the "base url", so that it could properly determine what parts of the url belong to the route, and what parts are actual arguments for the service call.</p>

<p>These classes will be used in my upcoming C# REST library, <a href="http://rest.codeplex.com" rel="nofollow">RestCake</a>.  I hope that my path down the routing rabbit hole will help anyone else who decides to RouteBase, and do cool stuff with IHttpHandlers.</p>

<p>Well you need to use "*" for multiplication. <strike>Plus I'm not sure whether C# allows ".123" style numeric literals without leading 0.</strike></p>

         (1.0324-0.19077*(Math.Log(Convert.ToDouble(TBWaist.Text)-Convert.ToDouble(TBNeck.Text)))+0.15456*(Math.Log(Convert.ToDouble(TBHeight.Text)))));

<p>In an C program, I need to re-initialize all global variables as they where when the program starts for tests purpose.</p>

<p>I want to reproduce the data copy from Load Memory Address, LMA to VMA (run-time address) done by GCC libraries with a reinitialization function.
For example, if foo variables are declared as global and initialized. And if my re-initialization function is re_init():</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
int foo1 = 42;
int foo2 = 777;

int main(){
    foo1 = 0;
    foo2 = 0;
    re_init();
    printf("foo1:%d and foo2:%d",foo1,foo2);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then I want to have as an output :</p>

<pre><code>foo1:42 and foo2:777
</code></pre>

<p>I believe that the right way to do this is to the default linker file and maybe the startup code that copy initiation values to RAM.
So, with GCC (cygwin), what should I do to achieve this?</p>

<p>I have a layout that creates a ListActivity. Before displaying the ListActivity, I perform a database query, and then hook that data up to the List using a SimpleCursorAdapter.</p>

<p>All of this works fine on 1.6 and higher. On 1.5, the my function that performs the query successfully executes, but then a few seconds later a StackOverflowError takes place. Does anyone know why this error would occur in 1.5 but not in 1.6?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I have determined that the crash occurs when I move from an Activity with a TabView to an Activity with the ListView. If I go to the ListView from an Activity that does not contain a Tab View, then the crash does not occur. The activity with the ListView is returning a Cursor to a query where the database has about 10 columns. Of those 10 columns, I display 3 columns on the screen.</p>

<p>Here is the flow of execution for my code:</p>

<pre><code>TabView Activity sends Intent to start List View Activity

onCreate() //of ListActivity
{
    showList();
}

showList()
{
    //open DataBase
    //perform query
    //create SimpleCursorAdapter
    //setListAdapter
}
</code></pre>

<p>So for example, this runs completely fine on a Droid with 2.1 installed and on an emulator targeting 1.6. But the above fails on the HTC Hero with 1.5 and on an emulator targeting 1.5.</p>

<p>The crash happens if I let setListAdapter execute. If that line is out, everything works, but obviously my data does not get shown. It doesn't crash on the line that calls setListAdapter, but it'll eventually crash if setListAdapter is ever executed.</p>

<p>Stack Trace:</p>

<p>Let's say I have a list of IDs and I want to see if rows already exist with those IDs in my SQL database. Is there a single SQL command that I can issue to get back the subset of the ID list that's not already represented in the database? I could iterate over each ID in my code and issue a separate SQL check for each ID, but that sounds inefficient.</p>

<p>I'm trying to do this against an sqlite database. thanks! </p>

<p>I'm building an ASP.NET MVC 2 site that uses LINQ to SQL. In one of the places where my site accesses the DB, I think a race condition is possible.</p>

<hr>

<h2>DB Architecture</h2>

<p>Here are some of the columns of the relevant DB table, named <code>Revisions</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>RevisionID</em> - bigint, IDENTITY, PK</li>
<li><em>PostID</em> - bigint, FK to PK of <code>Posts</code> table</li>
<li><em>EditNumber</em> - int</li>
<li><em>RevisionText</em> - nvarchar(max)</li>
</ul>

<p>On my site, users can submit a Post and edit a Post later on.  Users other than the original poster are able to edit a Post - so there is scope for multiple edits on a single Post simultaneously.</p>

<p>When submitting a Post, a record in the <code>Posts</code> table is created, as well as a record in the <code>Revisions</code> table with <em>PostID</em> set to the ID of the <code>Posts</code> record, <em>RevisionText</em> set to the Post text, and <em>EditNumber</em>  set to 1.</p>

<p>When editing a Post, only a <code>Revisions</code> record is created, <strong>with <em>EditNumber</em> being set to 1 higher than the latest edit number</strong>.</p>

<p>Thus, the <em>EditNumber</em> column refers to how many times a Post has been edited.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Incrementing <em>EditNumber</em></h2>

<p>The challenge that I see in implementing those functions is incrementing the <em>EditNumber</em> column. As that column can't be an <em>IDENTITY</em>, I have to manipulate its value manually.</p>

<p>Here's my LINQ query for determining what <em>EditNumber</em> a new Revision should have:</p>

<pre><code>using(var db = new DBDataContext())
{
    var rev = new Revision();
    rev.EditNumber = db.Revisions.Where(r =&gt; r.PostID == postID).Max(r =&gt; r.EditNumber) + 1;

    // ... (fill other properties)

    db.Revisions.InsertOnSubmit(rev);
    db.SubmitChanges();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Calculating a maximum and incrementing it can lead to a race condition</strong>.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to implement that function?</p>
^^
<p>Consider using a base class:</p>

<pre><code>class NoncopyableBase
{
public:
    NoncopyableBase() { }
    virtual ~NoncopyableBase() { }
private:
    NoncopyableBase(const NoncopyableBase&amp;);
    void operator=(const NoncopyableBase&amp;);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Any class derived from this base class will be noncopyable and will have a virtual destructor.</p>
^^
<p>Drop the IDs into a table and then try:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT C.id
FROM checkids C
LEFT JOIN mytable M
ON M.id = C.id
WHERE M.id IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>After looking over the code over TeamViewer, and finally downloading, compiling and running the code on my own machine, I <strong>believe</strong> this is a case of <strong>compiler error in C# 4.0</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've posted a question with request for verification, after managing to reduce the problem to a few simple projects and files. It is available here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3382231/possible-c-4-0-compiler-error-can-others-verify">Possible C# 4.0 compiler error, can others verify?</a></p>

<hr>

<p>The likely culprit is not this method:</p>

<pre><code>protected override List&lt;FeatureModel&gt; GetModels() {
    var fs = new FeatureService();
    var all = fs.FindAll();
    var wr = new WeakReference(all);
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(all != null, "FindAll must not return null");
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(wr.IsAlive);
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(all.ToString()); // throws NullReferenceException
    return all;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But the method it calls, FeatureService.FindAll:</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;FeatureModel&gt; FindAll() {
    string key = Cache.GetQueryKey("FindAll");
    var value = Cache.Load&lt;List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;&gt;(key);
    if (value == null) {
        var query = Context.Features;
        value = query.ToList().Select(x =&gt; Map(x)).ToList();
        var policy = Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy(value.Select(x =&gt; Cache.GetObjectKey(x.Id.ToString())), true);
        Cache.Store(key, value, policy);
    }
    value = new List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;();
    return value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I changed the call in GetModels from this:</p>

<pre><code>var all = fs.FindAll();
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>var all = fs.FindAll().ToList(); // remember, it already returned a list
</code></pre>

<p>then the program crashes with a <code>ExecutionEngineException</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>After doing a clean, a build, and then looking at the compiled code through Reflector, here's how the output looks (scroll to the bottom of the code for the important part):</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;FeatureModel&gt; FindAll()
{
    List&lt;FeatureModel&gt; value;
    Func&lt;FeatureModel, string&gt; CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate6 = null;
    List&lt;FeatureModel&gt; CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate7 = null;
    string key = base.Cache.GetQueryKey("FindAll");
    if (base.Cache.Load&lt;List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;&gt;(key) == null)
    {
        if (CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate6 == null)
        {
            CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate6 = (Func&lt;FeatureModel, string&gt;) delegate (Feature x) {
                return this.Map(x);
            };
        }
        value = base.Context.Features.ToList&lt;Feature&gt;().Select&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt;(((Func&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt;) CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate6)).ToList&lt;FeatureModel&gt;();
        if (CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate7 == null)
        {
            CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate7 = (List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;) delegate (FeatureModel x) {
                return base.Cache.GetObjectKey(x.Id.ToString());
            };
        }
        Func&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt; policy = (Func&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt;) base.Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy(value.Select&lt;FeatureModel, string&gt;((Func&lt;FeatureModel, string&gt;) CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate7), true);
        base.Cache.Store&lt;List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;&gt;(key, value, (CacheItemPolicy) policy);
    }
    value = new List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;();
    bool CS$1$0000 = (bool) value;
    return (List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;) CS$1$0000;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the 3 last lines of the method, here's what they look like in the code:</p>

<pre><code>value = new List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;();
return value;
</code></pre>

<p>here's what Reflector says:</p>

<pre><code>value = new List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;();
bool CS$1$0000 = (bool) value;
return (List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;) CS$1$0000;
</code></pre>

<p>It creates the list, then casts it to a boolean, then casts it back to a list and returns it. Most likely this causes a stack problem.</p>

<p>Here's the same method, in IL (still through Reflector), I've stripped away most of the code:</p>

<pre><code>.method public hidebysig instance class [mscorlib]System.Collections.Generic.List`1&lt;class FeatureCrowd.DomainModel.FeatureModel&gt; FindAll() cil managed

<p>We have a situation with a fairly complex entity/table hierarchy modelled with EF4.  Often we like most of the associations to load (whether lazy or not) and are happy with that.</p>

<p>Sometimes we want just the top of the hierarchy and maybe one or two of the related detail tables to be attached.  For example when returning a set from a WCF method - as expected it will load every associated entity on the spot where often we just need a couple of them.</p>

<p>I know we can do this with projection but that seems to be a third slower than the regular query.  I think we can also "clear()" the detail entity sets we do not want but that also would be a performance hit.</p>

<p>It seems crazy we can't pull the entity as normal and just prevent lazy loading from ocurring, or prevent selected details from ever being attached.  I think I am missing a simple thing.</p>

<p>Your help is appreciated</p>

<p>Can anyone think of a better way of writing this out in a loop and getting the same result?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am building a social networking site in rails and I want to have a very simple messaging system. More or less just: inbox and set messages.  Lastly, I'd ideally like for it to function like facebook; in the users profile you click "send message to <em>username</em>" and it takes you to a compose screen.</p>

<p>The only rails messaging system I've come across at all is: <a href="http://www.novawave.net/public/rails_messaging_tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novawave.net/public/rails_messaging_tutorial.html</a> and it seem to be pretty buggy and not exactly what I want, nor is it very modern or DRY.</p>

<p>I think I might have to just create my own but I'm having a hard time visualizing exactly how it work work:</p>

<p>I'd want to have a Message model that has both a sender and a recipient (both linked to seperate user IDs)....now that I think about this, it doesn't seem like it would be very complicated at all.  Any suggestions or tips?</p>
^^
<p>It depends on the scope of the custom variable. Page view scope will only send/report the first time.  You will have to include it in the onclick code that is triggered to get it to count each click.  </p>

<p>If you have it as a visit/session scope, in the reports, it will associate itself for each click event for the duration of the visit/session. </p>

<p>I have an iPhone application which is based on the "Window based application" template and which uses a main view with some embedded subviews.</p>

<p>For some action I need a confirmation by the user. Therefore, I create an UIActionSheet and ask the user for feedback.</p>

<p>The problem is, that the action sheet does not show at all. Instead, the screen gets darker. The sheet and the requested buttons do not show. After that, the application hangs. The darkening of the screen is a normal behavior as part of the animation which normally shows the action sheet.</p>

<p>Curiously, the same code works fine, if invoked in the viewDidLoad method. It does not work if invoked in the buttonPressed method which starts the action requiring the confirmation.</p>

<pre><code>- (void) trashButtonPressed {
   // This method is called in the button handler and (for testing
   // purposes) in the viewDidLoad method.
   NSLog( @"trashButtonPressed" );

   UIActionSheet* actionSheet =
        [[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitle: @"Test" 
                                    delegate: self 
                           cancelButtonTitle: @"Cancel"
                      destructiveButtonTitle: @"Delete Sheet"
                           otherButtonTitles: nil];

   [actionSheet showInView: self.view];
   [actionSheet release];
}

- (void)       willPresentActionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)  actionSheet {
   NSLog( @"willPresentActionSheet" );
}

- (void)       didPresentActionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)   actionSheet {
   NSLog( @"didPresentActionSheet" );
}

- (void)        actionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)actionSheet
  didDismissWithButtonIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex {
   NSLog( @"actionSheet:didDismissWithButtonIndex" );
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I have added some logging messages to the protocol handlers of the UIActionSheetDelegateProtocol. The "will present" and "did present" methods get called as expected, but the sheet does not show.</p>

<p>Does anybody know, what's wrong here?</p>

<h1>Haskell</h1>

<p>I've started to learn Haskell recently - here's an attempt in that lesser known (but very nice) language.</p>

<pre><code>main=readLn&gt;&gt;=print.f 2
f a 1=[]
f a x=if x`mod`a==0 then show a:f a(x`div`a)else f(a+1)x
</code></pre>

<p>89 characters, but cheating really because again the output format isn't right. I tried to correct the output but couldn't get it less than 208 chars:</p>

<pre><code>import List
main=readLn&gt;&gt;=w
w n=putStrLn.foldl1(++).v n.map m.group.f 2$n
m a=' ':head a++j(length a)
v n=((s n++":"):)
s=show
j 1=[]
j n='^':s n
f a 1=[]
f a x=if x`mod`a==0 then s a:f a(x`div`a)else f(a+1)x

<p>Any improvements welcomed. On a side note, I was amazed how much whitespace GHC lets you remove without complaining.</p>

<p>Personally, I would remove the copy constructor declaration. You have pure virtual functions so instances of this class can't be created by slicing in any case. If a derived class isn't copyable because of the nature of a resource that it holds; it can mark itself as non-copyable.</p>

<p>Then I would get rid of the protected default constructor; it doesn't do anything and you have to derive from this class in any case as you have pure virtual functions so it's not preventing any usage.</p>

<p>Although marking the copy assignment operator prevents someone doing <code>*pBase1 = *pBase2</code> (effectively a no-op), personally I'm not convinced that it's worth the bother of trying to prevent it. As your class has no data members there's no inherent danger in the compiler generated one, it's really up to user to use pointers or references to base classes appropriately.</p>

<p>I would just go with:</p>

<pre><code>class Output
{
public:
    virtual ~Output() {}
    virtual void write( const std::vector&lt;char&gt; &amp;data ) = 0;
};
</code></pre>
^^
<p>This applies to several cases in my application:</p>

<p>I have 3 or 4 functions that belong together, one is a starting function that creates and frees the required memory structures and calls the other functions as appropriate. The other functions also call themselves repeatedly. Only the starting functions is called from outside, and only once or not at all per application-run.</p>

<p>Currently, I pass pointers to the memory structures from the starting function as function arguments, but the argument list is getting quite long in some cases.</p>

<p>Is there any argument against creating classes for all these cases and making the pointers to the memory structures members?</p>
^^
<p>I believe that the most important thing you must analyze is which kind of information do you want to extract. If you want to extract entire websites like google does probably your best option is to analyze tools like nutch from Apache.org or flaptor solution <a href="http://ww.hounder.org" rel="nofollow">http://ww.hounder.org</a> If you need to extract particular areas on unstructured data documents - websites, docs, pdf - probably you can extend nutch plugins to fit particular needs. nutch.apache.org</p>

<p>On the other hand if you need to extract particular text or clipping areas of a website where you set rules using DOM of the page probably what you need to check is more related to tools like mozenda.com. with those tools you will be able to set up extraction rules in order to scrap particular information on a website. You must take into consideration that any change on a webpage will give you an error on your robot.</p>

<p>Finally, If you are planning to develop a website using information sources you could purchase information from companies such as spinn3r.com were they sell particular niches of information ready to be consume. You will be able to save lots of money on infrastructure.
hope it helps!.

<p>A client appeared to have a similar problem.  I solved it by making hundreds of sessions rather than passing in hundreds of requests in one session.

<p>Update directly in the database and return the new revision:</p>

<pre><code>update Revisions
set EditNumber += 1
output INSERTED.EditNumber
where PostID = @postId;
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not possible in LINQ. In fact, is not possible in the client <em>at all</em>, no matter the technology used, short of doing pessimistic locking which has too many drawback to worth considering.</p>

<p>Updated:</p>

<p>Here is how I would insert a new revision (including first revision):</p>

<pre><code>create procedure usp_insertPostRevision
  @postId int,
  @text nvarchar(max),
  @revisionId bigint output

as 
begin
  set nocount on;
  declare @nextEditNumber (EditNumber int not null);
  declare @rc int = 0;

  begin transaction;
  begin try
    update Posts
    set LastRevision += 1
    output INSERTED.LastRevision
       into @nextEditNumber (EditNumber)
    where PostId = @postId;

    set @rc = @@rowcount;

    if (@rc &lt;&gt; 1)
      raiserror (N'Expected exactly one post with Id:%i. Found:%i', 
        16, 1 , @postId, @rc);

    insert into Revisions
      (PostId, Text, EditNumber)
    select @postID, @text, EditNumber
    from @nextEditNumber;

    set @revisionId = scope_identity();

    commit;    
  end try
  begin catch
   ... // Error handling omitted
  end catch
end
</code></pre>

<p>I omitted the error handling, see <a href="http://rusanu.com/2009/06/11/exception-handling-and-nested-transactions/" rel="nofollow">Exception handling and nested transactions</a> for a template procedure than handles errors and nested transactions properly. </p>

<p>You'll notice the Posts table has a LastRevision field that is used as the increment for the post revisions. This is much better than computing the MAX each time you add a revision, as it avoid a (range) scan of Revisions. It also acts as a concurrency protection: only one transaction at a time will be able to update it, and only that transaction will proceed with inserting a new revision. Concurrent transactions will block and wait until the first one commits, then the next transaction unblocked will correctly update the revision number to +1.</p>

<p>It sounds to me like these functions belong in a class - with the internal functions private or protected - likewise with the members.</p>

<p>Here is a "developer-friendly" version of the "<strong>one query</strong>, <strong>no recursion</strong>" solution.</p>

<p><strong>SQL</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT id, parent_id, title, link, position FROM menu_item ORDER BY parent_id, position;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>PHP</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>$html = '';
$parent = 0;
$parent_stack = array();

// $items contains the results of the SQL query
$children = array();
foreach ( $items as $item )
    $children[$item['parent_id']][] = $item;

while ( ( $option = each( $children[$parent] ) || ( $parent &gt; 0 ) )
{
    if ( !empty( $option ) )
    {
        // 1) The item contains children:
        // store current parent in the stack, and update current parent
        if ( !empty( $children[$option['value']['id']] ) )
        {
            $html .= '&lt;li&gt;' . $option['value']['title'] . '&lt;/li&gt;';
            $html .= '&lt;ul&gt;'; 
            array_push( $parent_stack, $parent );
            $parent = $option['value']['id'];
        }
        // 2) The item does not contain children
        else
            $html .= '&lt;li&gt;' . $option['value']['title'] . '&lt;/li&gt;';
    }
    // 3) Current parent has no more children:
    // jump back to the previous menu level
    else
    {
        $html .= '&lt;/ul&gt;';
        $parent = array_pop( $parent_stack );
    }
}

// At this point, the HTML is already built
echo $html;
</code></pre>

<p>You just need to understand the usage of the $parent_stack variable.</p>

<p>It is a "LIFO" stack (Last In, First Out) - the image in the Wikipedia article worths a thousand words: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO_%28computing%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO_%28computing%29</a></p>

<p>When a menu option has sub-options, we store its parent ID in the stack:</p>

<pre><code>array_push( $parent_stack, $parent );
</code></pre>

<p>And then, we immediately update $parent, making it be the current menu option ID:</p>

<pre><code>$parent = $option['value']['id'];
</code></pre>

<p>After we looped all its sub-options, we can return back to the previous level:</p>

<pre><code>$parent = array_pop( $parent_stack );
</code></pre>

<p>This is why we stored the parent ID in the stack!</p>

<p>My suggestion is: contemplate the code snippet above, and understand it.</p>

<p>Questions are welcome!</p>

<p>One of the advantages I see in this approach is that it eliminates the risk of entering into an infinite loop, which can happen when recursion is used.</p>

<p>I looked in the source code and found the regex used to do the emphasis:</p>

<pre><code>var $em_relist = array(
    ''  =&gt; '(?:(?&lt;!\*)\*(?!\*)|(?&lt;!_)_(?!_))(?=\S|$)(?![.,:;]\s)',
    '*' =&gt; '(?&lt;=\S|^)(?&lt;!\*)\*(?!\*)',
    '_' =&gt; '(?&lt;=\S|^)(?&lt;!_)_(?!_)',
    );
var $strong_relist = array(
    ''   =&gt; '(?:(?&lt;!\*)\*\*(?!\*)|(?&lt;!_)__(?!_))(?=\S|$)(?![.,:;]\s)',
    '**' =&gt; '(?&lt;=\S|^)(?&lt;!\*)\*\*(?!\*)',
    '__' =&gt; '(?&lt;=\S|^)(?&lt;!_)__(?!_)',
    );
var $em_strong_relist = array(
    ''    =&gt; '(?:(?&lt;!\*)\*\*\*(?!\*)|(?&lt;!_)___(?!_))(?=\S|$)(?![.,:;]\s)',

<p>I can't really think of any "dangers" besides the possibility of causing a circular reference and thus a memory leak in case of DOM objects or such.</p>

<p>It works much like a private variable in a class.</p>
^^
<p>Can someone please explain me the following code snippet?</p>

<pre><code>value struct ValueStruct {
    int x;
};

void SetValueOne(ValueStruct% ref) {
    ref.x = 1;
}

void SetValueTwo(ValueStruct ref) {
    ref.x = 2;
}

void SetValueThree(ValueStruct^ ref) {
    ref-&gt;x = 3;
}

ValueStruct^ first = gcnew ValueStruct;
first-&gt;x = 0;
SetValueOne(*first);

ValueStruct second;
second.x = 0;
SetValueTwo(second); // am I creating a copy or what? is this copy Disposable even though value types don't have destructors?

ValueStruct^ third = gcnew ValueStruct;
third-&gt;x = 0;
SetValueThree(third); // same as the first ?
</code></pre>

<p>And my second question is: is there any reason to have something like that?:</p>

<pre><code>ref struct RefStruct {
    int x;
};

RefStruct% ref = *gcnew RefStruct;
// rather than:
// RefStruct^ ref = gcnew RefStruct;

// can I retrieve my handle from ref?
// RefStruct^ myref = ???

<p>What is more: I see no difference between value type and ref type, since both can be pointed by handler ;(</p>

<p>You can get around that by making the static WndProc delegate everything to the members:</p>

    /* Pass &amp;WndProc as the pointer to the Window procedure */

    // Register the window
    windowMap[m_handle] = this;

<p>The last 2 relative layouts are swappable and are aligned fine. Only one of them appear at a time and is changed on a button click.

<p>The inner function does not have access to a "snapshot", it has full access to the <code>data</code> variable.</p>

<pre><code>function outer() {
    var data = 1;

    ...

    someObject.method = function () {
        data = 42;
    };

    someObject.method();
    // data == 42
}
</code></pre>

<p>(The real explanation being that when using <code>data</code> in the inner function, Javascript will try to figure out which scope <code>data</code> is in. It will traverse up the scope chain to find the place where the variable was created, and that's the variable that will be used.)</p>

<p>There's no "danger", this is one of the core competencies of Javascript. It's like an object method modifying an object's properties. Of course you need to take care what you want to do, do you really want to modify the variable or do you just want to use it locally?</p>

<p>For the "snapshot", you need to use a closure:</p>

<pre><code>function outer() {
    var data = 1;

    ...

    someObject.method = (function (data) {
        return function () {
            data = 42;
        }
    })(data);

    someObject.method();
    // data == 1
}

<p>Yes, relate them all within a class.</p>

<p>This will also give you a cleaner code which might help you minimize the functions' arguments lists.</p>

<p>In simple words an object can be anything you decide. Say a person. This is an object which I'll decide to define as a class if I'll write a program that needs to keep information regarding people.<br>
There are much better explanations than this, just google/wikipedia it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm trying to build an array in javascript that contains a list of ids.  Here is a simplified version of the function that I have...</p>

<pre><code>function updateCost(id) {
    var inputArray = [];
    inputArray.push(id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the html code...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="file" name="field1" id="field1" onchange="updateCost('1');" /&gt;
&lt;input type="file" name="field2" id="field2" onchange="updateCost('2');" /&gt;
&lt;input type="file" name="field3" id="field3" onchange="updateCost('3');" /&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to happen, is each time I select a file from my computer using one of the file input fields that I have, I would like the id of that input field to be stored in the inputArray array.  However, every time I select a file, it adds that id to the array, but it doesn't append it to the array, so everything else in the array is deleted, leaving only one entry in the array.</p>

<p>Is there any way to make the array data persistent so it will grow each time I use one of the of the file input fields?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>It seems to be a quite typical use case for classes: Just add the "memory structure" as protected member of the class and initiliaze it in the constructor.</p>

<p>The member functions (aka "method") than can work on the data.</p>

<p>If you have different, but similiar use cases, you may also make use of subclassing, so you create a base class with default implementation and create some derived class that overwrites some of the methods with an own implementation.</p>

<p>But note, that you could also use other members varibales to set the behaviour at runtime (e.g. a bool that is used to toggle on or off a specific behaviour).</p>

<p>Your question is too abstract to see what is the best solution for your case. Remember, often there are a lot of solutions - and so there is more than one good solution.</p>
^^
<p><strike>I wonder if <code>[actionSheet showInView: self.view];</code> is enough to have the actionSheet have itself retained by self.view.</strike> (<strong>edit</strong>: retain count jumps from 1 to 4 so not a problem here)</p>

<p>Have you checked the dimensions of your view? The sheet is positioned within the view, but if self.view would refer to a big scrollview, you might just have a sheet below the surface. In short, are you sure that self.view.frame and self.view.bounds have the same values in the two situations you are referring to? Is it the same view (when just <code>NSLog(@"%x",self.view)</code>-ing it's address)?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> to clarify: do</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@"%d %d %d %d",
        self.view.frame.origin.x,self.view.frame.origin.y,
        self.view.frame.size.width,self.view.frame.size.height);
</code></pre>

<p>and please tell what you see on the console. I get your "screen just gets darker" if I set either a 0,0,0,0 frame or a 0,0,320,800 frame, so this might be it...</p>
^^
<p>In your app/config/routes.php file you could add:</p>

<p><code>Router::connect('/users/*', array('controller' =&gt; 'users', 'action' =&gt; 'index'));</code></p>

<p>This would route all requests to /users/ to the index action of the users controller.  If you want to use a different action, just replace 'index' with the action you prefer to use.</p>

<p>I'm looking at this on an iPhone, so I can't see all of your code but you should probably be using ".html" instead of ".replaceWith". The former replaces the content <em>inside</em> the specifies tag, the latter wipes out the tags, too.</p>

<p>You can insert the city records, use mysql_insert_id() after the insert to get the cityid for the inserted record, and then redirect to a details posting page with e.g. a URL parameter for the cityid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>unfortunately, I didn't find a nice way to do this with just a single macro.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMO, the easiest solution is to put default methods into macro. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;

#define DEFAULT_CLASS_METHODS(C) public: \
        virtual ~C(){}; \
    protected: \
        C(){}; \
    private: \
        inline C(const C&amp; rhs){}; \
        inline void operator=(const C&amp; other){}; 

class Output{
    DEFAULT_CLASS_METHODS(Output)
public:
    virtual void write(const std::vector&lt;char&gt; &amp;data) = 0;
};
</code></pre>

<p>This way you'll need only one macro per class definition in *.h file. You will need additional macro to actually declare copy constructor and assignment operator in some *.cpp file or you could make default copy constructor and assignment operators inline, which will wrap everything into single macro. </p>

<p>The only problem is that you'll need to type class name twice. </p>

<p>There is a less elegant way to do that without typing class name twice:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;

#define BEGIN_INTERFACE(C) class C{ \
    public: \
        virtual ~C(){}; \
    protected: \
        C(){}; \
    private: \
        inline C(const C&amp; rhs){}; \
        inline void operator=(const C&amp; other){}; 

BEGIN_INTERFACE(Output)
public:
    virtual void write(const std::vector&lt;char&gt; &amp;data) = 0;
};
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, in this case macro eats opening <code>{</code> bracket, which will be very misleading.</p>
^^
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by <em>"selected by user text"</em>, but if you mean that you want the user to be able to click on the text to remove its color, you could do it this way with jQuery:</p>

<p><strong>Try it out:</strong> <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/</a></p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('div &gt; span').click(function() {
        $(this).removeAttr('style');
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this will affect all <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements that are a child of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, so better would be to place an ID attribute on the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to make sure you have the right one.</p>

<p><strong>Try it out:</strong> <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/1/</a></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="myID"&gt;&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:white;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>then</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('#myID &gt; span').click(function() {
        $(this).removeAttr('style');
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that this will remove <em>all</em> inline styles. If you only want to remove the color, then do this:</p>

<p><strong>Try it out:</strong> <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/2/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/2/</a></p>

<pre><code>$(function() {

<p>Basically, I want to get an update of the standard command-line subversion client for Windows. I used to be able to get downloads of this quite easily, but it seems like registration is required these days.</p>

<p>I object to registration, but equally, I prefer not to use workarounds that e.g. involve registering with details that won't stay valid.</p>

<p>I already have TortoiseSVN - this isn't about clients in general, but specifically about the standard command-line client. I also don't need the server stuff - just the client.</p>

<p>It looks like I <em>can</em> download the source, but building from that probably involves the usual dependency-finding issues and so on. As this is likely to be a recurring issue, I'd prefer to avoid it if possible.</p>

<p>I'll be more than happy with a torrent link. Googling for that specifically, though, just leads to a lot of what look like pirate versions of commercial clients.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Or is there some good reason for collecting these registration details that might override my objections?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Applogies to everyone I "sigh"ed at or whatever over SlikSVN suggestions. Clearly, I need to do better at avoiding making bad assumptions.</p>
^^
<pre><code>(function() {


   var inputArray = [];
   function updateCost(id) {
    inputArray.push(id);
   }


})();
</code></pre>

<p>Define it outside the scope of the function. You don't really need the enclosing anon function around, that's just my personal style.</p>
^^
<p>Hi I'm trying to do the same way,  but I'm getting retCode= 11.  </p>

<p>any suggestion?</p>
^^
<p>Use a <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html" rel="nofollow"><code>TreeSet</code></a> instead. It has a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html#TreeSet%28java.util.Comparator%29" rel="nofollow">constructor taking a <code>Comparator</code></a>. It will automatically sort the <code>Set</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to convert a <code>HashSet</code> to a <code>TreeSet</code>, then do so:</p>

<pre><code>Set&lt;YourObject&gt; hashSet = getItSomehow();
Set&lt;YourObject&gt; treeSet = new TreeSet&lt;YourObject&gt;(new YourComparator());
treeSet.addAll(hashSet);
// Now it's sorted based on the logic as implemented in YourComparator.
</code></pre>

<p>If the items you have itself already implements <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Comparable</code></a> and its default ordering order is already what you want, then you basically don't need to supply a <code>Comparator</code>. You could then construct the <code>TreeSet</code> directly based on the <code>HashSet</code>. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; hashSet = getItSomehow();
Set&lt;String&gt; treeSet = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;(hashSet);
// Now it's sorted based on the logic as implemented in String#compareTo().
</code></pre>

<p>As you said, you can certainly download and build the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/source-code.html#source-release" rel="nofollow">source code</a>; it's free software under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" rel="nofollow">Apache License 2.0</a>.

<p>Which site are you downloading from?  Just taking a look at the download links from the SVN project home (http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html), I see four options for Windows, several of which do not have registration, at least.  The SlikSVN link is free and has command line utilities.</p>

<p>You could also install Cygwin, which is definitely free and comes with other useful utilities.</p>

<p>I'm new to hibernate. I have a transaction that fails with a HibernateException, yet the table is altered after the commit. Here is the code:</p>

  <p>"Remove style from selected by user text"</p>

<p>If you mean selecting by using a click event, it should be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var oldState = "";  //Code is untested, but I've written something similar recently
var $prevDiv;
$('#parentContainer span').click(function() {
    if(!$(this).hasClass('selected')) //tracking what is currently selected.
    { 
        if($prevDiv != null)
        {
            $prevDiv.removeClass('selected');  
            $prevDiv.attr('style', oldState);
        }
        $prevDiv = $(this);
        $(this).addClass('selected');
        oldState = $(this).attr('style');
        $(this).attr('style', '');

    }
    else 
    {
        //do nothing unless you need some reselected logic

<p>I'm getting used to Haskell's higher-order functions. Usually I can replace explicit patterns of recursion with functions like map, fold, and scan. However, I often run into the following recursion pattern which I don't understand how to express using higher-order functions:</p>

<pre><code>   f (x:[]) = k x
   f (x:xs) = g x (f xs)
</code></pre>

<p>For instance, suppose I am representing analytic tableaux. Then I create a data type such as:</p>

<pre><code>   data Tableau = N Expr | S Expr (Tableau) | B Expr (Tableau) (Tableau)
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to convert a list of <code>Expr</code>s into a tableau structure, I want a function part of which might resemble:</p>

<pre><code>   f (x:[]) = N x
   f (x:xs) = S x (f xs)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I see three options: (1) create a function which decides, given a tableau and a list, whether the next branch in the tableau should be an <code>S</code> or <code>N</code> (or <code>B</code>, but we'll ignore that case); (2) use a higher-order function to encapsulate the recursion pattern of <code>f</code>; (3) use a function like <code>f</code>. </p>

<p>What would the best option be?</p>
^^
<p>WSGI itself offers no way of knowing what layers are already wrapping a certain application, nor does Apache know about that.  I would recommend having the <code>wsgiHandler</code> record its presence, so that you can avoid using it multiple times.  If you can't alter the existing code, you can do it with your own wrappers for that code's layer (and use the environment, directly or indirectly, to do the recording of what's already active).</p>

<p>I am currently working on my own version of membership using Entity Framework 4.0 and POCO.</p>

<p>After readying Scotts Gu blog post I decided to use conventions as much as possible.</p>

<p>So far I have a class called User:</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Key]
    public int UserId { get; set; }

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.StringLength(60)] 
    public string UserName { get; set; }

    public string Password { get; set; }

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.ConcurrencyCheck]
    public string Email { get; set; }

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Timestamp]
    public byte[] Timestamp { get; set; }

    public ICollection&lt;Role&gt; Roles { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and a class called Role</p>

<pre><code>public class Role
{
    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Key]
    public int RoleId { get; set; }

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.StringLength(50)]
    public string RoleName { get; set; }

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.StringLength(300)]
    public string RoleDescription { get; set; }

    public ICollection&lt;User&gt; Users { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also implement DbContext like this :</p>

<pre><code>public class BackboneDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet&lt;User&gt; Users { get; set; }
    public DbSet&lt;Role&gt; Roles { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then based on what Scott suggested I created a Initializer class inheriting from RecreateDatabaseIfModelChanges.</p>

<p>Then in that class I add some dummy items like this:</p>

<pre><code>    protected override void Seed(BackboneDbContext context)
    {
        var roles = new List&lt;Role&gt;
        {
            new Role
                {
                    RoleId = 0,
                    RoleName = "User",
                    RoleDescription = "This role belong to normal users.",
                }

        };

        roles.ForEach(r =&gt; context.Roles.Add(r));

        var users = new List&lt;User&gt;
        {
            new User  {UserId = 1, 
                       UserName = "Elham", 
                       Email = "abc@yahoo.com", 
                       Password = "xyz",
                       Roles = new List&lt;Role&gt;
                                   {
                                      roles[0]
                                   }

                       }

        };

        users.ForEach(u =&gt; context.Users.Add(u));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I hope it make sense up to here. If not, basically the above code populate the tables with dummy data if database schema changes.</p>

<p>so far everything is absolutely great. I get the following tables:</p>

<p>Roles, Roles_Users and Users</p>

<p>they all have the info I need, but the problem is when I use the following LINQ query in my Repository class to get all the USers:</p>

<pre><code>    public IQueryable&lt;User&gt; GetAllUsers()
    {
        IQueryable&lt;User&gt; allUsers = from u in _backboneDbContext.Users select u;

        return allUsers;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>now if I check allUsers before passing it to View, I get my users but the Role is set to 'Null'</p>

<p>I don't know why... Any Ideas ? Thank you.</p>
^^
<p>Does anyone know how to do this?</p>

<p>Is anyone able to provide an example? I believe this is out of NDA now as was available in version 4.0 ?</p>

<p>Learn about how to create a custom membership provider, then see why Microsoft guys make it that way. </p>

<p>Actually the provider is a bridge between a User object, and its data stored in the database or another place. So a custom membership provider offers you enough flexibility.</p>

<p>The general technique of allowing a window instance to be represented by as class instance is to make use of the SetWindowLongPtr and GetWindowLongPtr to associate your class instance pointer with the window handle.  Below is some sample code to get you started.  It may not compile without a few tweaks.  It's only meant to be a reference.</p>

<p>Personally, I've stopped rolling my own window classes back a few years ago when I discovered ATL's CWindow and CWindowImpl template class.  They take care of doing all this mundane coding for you so can focus on just writing methods that handle window messages.  See the example code I wrote up <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3122695/what-is-an-efficient-way-to-wrap-hwnds-in-objects-in-c/3122743#3122743">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>Using SQLite and Python 3.1, I want to display currency data in a HTML table via. a template which accepts a cursor as a parameter.  Hence all currency values must have 2 decimal places, but SQLite stores them as float type (even though the structure states decimal :-( ) so some must be converted before display (eg. I want 12.1 displayed as 12.10).</p>

<p>The code goes something like this (simplified for illustration)...</p>

<pre><code>import sqlite3
con = sqlite3.connect("mydb")
con.row_factory = sqlite3.Row

cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute("select order_no, amount from orders where cust_id=123")

for row in cur:
   row['amount'] = format(row['amount'],'%.2f')
</code></pre>

<p>The last command throws the error "# builtins.TypeError: 'sqlite3.Row' object does not support item assignment"</p>

<p>How can I solve the problem whereby the row object values cannot be changed?  Could I convert the cursor to a list of dictionaries (one for each row, eg. [{'order_no':1, 'amount':12.1}, {'order_no':2, 'amount':6.32}, ...]), then format the 'amount' value for each item?  If so, how can I do this?</p>

<p>Are there any better solutions for achieving my goal?  Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>TIA,
Alan</p>

<p>A variable is <em>defined</em> as a storage location. So the question is: does a storage location <em>consume memory</em>? </p>

<p>When you say it that way it sounds obvious that the answer is yes. What else would a storage location do other than consume memory?</p>

<p>It's not as simple as that. A local variable can consume no memory at all; a local variable <em>might be enregistered by the jitter</em>. In that case it would consume neither stack nor heap memory.</p>

<p>Why do you care? The way that the CLR manages memory to make storage locations for variables is an implementation detail. Unless you're writing unsafe code, you don't have to worry about it.</p>

<p>You can do it all through the control panel.   Each theme has a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Themes_SubPanel" rel="nofollow">Delete link</a> that you can use to wipe it from the server's file system.   Once it's gone, you can re-intall your updated version.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm writing a web page. How do I know what doc type to use?:</p>

<p>I believe the rationale behind using Transitional is that if your page uses deprecated html elements, the browsers will try to support them? </p>

<p>It is quite likely that your problem arises due to the presence of a default (xhtml) namespace in the source XHTML file (which you have not shown to us, so this is a guess at best).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
    &lt;div class="class1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Text1&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="foo"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Text2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>the wanted, correct result is produced</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
   &lt;div class="class1"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Text1&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class="class2"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Text2&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Using a namespace prefix in the match expression of the template is necessary</strong>, because XPath considers any unprefixed name in "no namespace" and a match expression with non-prefixed names does not match any nodes, because it specifies nodes in "no namspace", but all the nodes of the source document are in the XHTML namespace.</p>

<p><strong>In case there is no default namespace in the source document, the transformation can be simplified</strong>:</p>

<p>
 
 </p>

<p>
     
       
     
 </p>

<p>
</p>

<p><strong>When this transformation is applied on the following XML document</strong> (note that it doesn't define a default namespace):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;div class="class1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Text1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="foo"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Text foo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="class2"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Text2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>the wanted, correct result is produced</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;div class="class1"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Text1&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class="class2"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Text2&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Both transformation use the identity rule</strong> to copy any node of the document <strong>and another template, which overrides the identity rule for nodes matching <code>"div[@class='foo']"</code></strong>. This second template is empty (has no body), which means that the matched node and the subtree rooted in it are not processed at all (ignored) and thus will not appear in the output.</p>

<p>You can always check Request.ServerVariables["REMOTE_HOST"] against your own white list within your app.</p>
^^
<p>Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure you can't do it for a single page via IIS (seek Serverfault.com for more details if you want verification), but if you wanted to do it programmatically, you could hook Application_BeginRequest in your global.asax file. Check the request URL and the request IP address against your restrictions, and only allow the request to continue if they pass. </p>
^^
<p>The following resource demonstrates how to detect the client IP in ASP.NET:</p>

<p><a href="http://bytes.com/topic/asp-classic/answers/439176-how-get-clients-ip-address-asp-net" rel="nofollow">http://bytes.com/topic/asp-classic/answers/439176-how-get-clients-ip-address-asp-net</a></p>

<p>Once you have the IP, load your whitelist from the storage mechanism of your choice, perhaps during an Init event (if in a page), and if the IP fails to match, respond like so (Use <code>HttpContext.Current.Response</code> if not in a page:</p>

<pre><code>if (!mySafeIpList.Contains(clientIP))
{
    Response.Clear()
    Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized
    Response.End()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, just simply redirect to a valid page:</p>

<pre><code>Response.Redirect("~/Head-Fake.aspx")
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm using a table element in my page layout (because I can't get divs to work 100% the way I want).</p>

<p>I just read this article about using a table style for divs:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/everything_you_know_about_CSS_Is_wrong/" rel="nofollow">http://www.digital-web.com/articles/everything_you_know_about_CSS_Is_wrong/</a></p>

<p>is this widely supported right now, is anyone using this method? If I look at major sites like twitter etc, I see tables being used, so I'm wondering if it's not a good idea to switch over,</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
^^
<p>Hi everyone.
I'm struggling with this simple idea.
Look at reddit, when you sign up for a new account.. you automatically subscribe to some default channels.</p>

<p>I want to do the same with my website.</p>

<p>I know I could do the simple and stupid <strong>user_chan</strong> with id, user_id, chan_id</p>

<p>if <strong>chan</strong> is like this :</p>

<pre><code>ID | NAME
1  | videos
2  | pictures
</code></pre>

<p><strong>user_chan</strong> would be like this (i'm user 1)</p>

<pre><code>ID | USER_ID | CHAN_ID
1  | 1       | 1
2  | 1       | 2
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to be very clear here :D</p>

<p>I guess that's how reddit works. But everytime a user signs up, they must have to insert a dozen of rows. And I guess they have tons of users !!</p>

<p>So is a solution inside <strong>user</strong> table like this more clever ?:</p>

<pre><code>ID | USER_NICKNAME | CHANS
1  | me            | 1,2
</code></pre>
^^
<p>Yep...:</p>

<pre><code>dictrows = [dict(row) for rows in cur]
for r in dictrows:
  r['amount'] = format(r['amount'],'%.2f')
</code></pre>

<p>there are other ways, but this one seems the simplest and most direct one.</p>
^^
<p>I was able to grab only individual <code>_enclosed_</code> words via:</p>

<pre><code>$input = 'test of _this_ vs stuff_like_this...and here is _anothermatch_ and_another_fake_string';
$pattern = '#(?&lt;=\s|^)(?&lt;!_)(_[^_]*_)(?!_)#is';
preg_match_all($pattern, $input, $matches);
print_r($matches);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure how exactly that would fit into the above code though. You would probably need to pair it with the other patterns below to account for the two and three match situations:</p>

<pre><code>$pattern = '#(?&lt;=\s|^)(?&lt;!_)(__[^_]*__)(?!_)#is';
$pattern = '#(?&lt;=\s|^)(?&lt;!_)(___[^_]*___)(?!_)#is';

<p>Hello, </p>

<p>I am using <code>contentEditable</code> div tags on my website and I have noticed a weird issue when using Firefox.</p>

<p><strong>Here is example source code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div contentEditable="true" style="margin-left:auto; 
         margin-right:auto; height:200px; width:200px; border-style:solid; 
         border-color:black; border-width:1px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Here are the steps to reproduce.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><code>contentEditable</code> has focus and cursor
is blinking within the div, but
there is NO text in the div</li>
<li>user click on the <code>contentEditable</code>
div</li>
<li>the div still shows focus, but there
is now NO blinking cursor, and the
user cannot enter input into the div</li>
</ol>

<p>I have reproduced this error with Firefox 3.6.3 on Ubuntu, and Firefox 3.5 on Windows XP. It does not happen with Chrome.</p>

<p>Any ideas about why this is happening and what to do to fix it?</p>

<p><b> EDIT: </b> One possible work around might be to manually set where the cursor is. Does anyone know how to do this? I've been searching online, but it doesn't look like there is anything W3 supported.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
^^
<p>I use RegexBuddy too. :)</p>

<p>You may want to try the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$line1 = "like_this_example";
$line2 = "I want only _example_ to become example";
$pattern = '/\b_(?P&lt;word&gt;.*?)_\b/si';

if (preg_match($pattern, $line1, $matches))
{
  $result = $matches['word'];
  var_dump($result);
}

if (preg_match($pattern, $line2, $matches))
{
  $result = $matches['word'];
  var_dump($result);
}

<p>Do not use one column to store multiple values. This is a denormalization that will cause pain later. E.g., when you need to query which user has channel 3, you are going to have to use <code>LIKE</code>, which will perform badly. When you need to remove just one channel of the several the user has, it gets even harder.</p>

<p>With most databases, you can insert multiple rows with one <code>INSERT</code> statement. The exact syntax varies by platform; in SQL Server, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>insert into user_chan
(USER_ID, CHANID)
select 7634, 3
union all
select 7634, 27
union all
select 7634, 9
</code></pre>

<p>Seems to be supported in <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/display.html" rel="nofollow">all but Internet Explorer 5, 6 and 7.</a></p>

<p>Well, you could maybe use <code>Set</code> instead and use the <code>removeAll()</code> method.</p>

<p>Or you could use the following simple and slow algorithm for doing:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Animal&gt; differences = new ArrayList&lt;Animal&gt;();

    for (Animal a1 : animals) {
       boolean isInSecondArray = false;
       for (Animal a2 : animals2) {
           if (a1 == a2)  {
                isInSecondArray = true;
                break;
           }
       } 

       if (!isInSecondArray)
           differences.add(a1)
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>differences</code> will have all the objects that are in <code>animals</code> array but not in <code>animals2</code> array. In a similar way you can do the opposite (get all the objects that are in <code>animals2</code> but not in <code>animals</code>).</p>

<p>By executing <code>delete</code> twice (or even <code>free</code>), the memory may already be reallocated and by executing <code>delete</code> again may cause memory corruption. The size of the block of memory allocated is often held just before the memory block itself. </p>

<p>If you have a derived class, do not call delete on the derived class (child). If it is not declared virtual then only the <code>~BaseClass()</code> destructor is called leaving any allocated memory from the <code>DerivedClass</code> to persist and leak. This assumes that the <code>DerivedClass</code> has extra memory allocated above and beyond that of the <code>BaseClass</code> which must be freed. </p>

<p>i.e.</p>

<pre><code>BaseClass* obj_ptr = new DerivedClass;  // Allowed due to polymorphism.
...
delete obj_ptr;  // this will call the destructor ~Parent() and NOT ~Child()
</code></pre>

  <h3>Standards mode, more stable validation target</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>This doctype also triggers the standards mode, and the decade-old HTML 4.01 validity definition is stable. Please be sure to test your image alignment in Firefox, Safari, Chrome or Opera 9 or 10. Testing image alignment with Internet Explorer is inadequate however be sure to test in IE8, too.</p>
  
  <h3>You’d like to use the Standards mode, but you still want to validate deprecated markup or you use sliced images in table layouts and don’t want to fix them</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>This gives you the Almost Standards mode (and the full Standards mode in really old Mozilla releases). Please note that your layouts based on sliced images in tables are <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/faq.html#gaps" rel="nofollow">likely to break</a> if you later move to HTML5 (and, hence, the full Standards mode).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd say, go for HTML5 doctype <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, unless you want a more stable validation target.</p>

<p>I'd use <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/2005/07/html5-doctype" rel="nofollow"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></a>, it's by far the easiest alternative, and it triggers standards mode in all modern browsers as <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/2005/07/html5-doctype" rel="nofollow">Anne van Kesteren noted several years ago</a>.</p>

<p>The key difference between T-SQL and Win32 Filestream access is the way data is transferred to the client - using T-SQL to retrieve Filestream data means the storage engine must open the file on NTFS, stream data back through the SQL engine and through TDS (the standard way SQL data is transferred) back to the client. If using Win32 the storage engine is still in the path during the open file operation however once this is complete the data can be transferred directly from the file to the client through Win32 streaming, completely bypassing the SQL engine.</p>

<p>As the blob size increases the overhead of opening the file and transferring through the engine becomes a smaller percentage of the total time required to complete the data transfer. Recent benchmarks for a very specific case study put the thresholds at 60KB for inline (varbinary max storage), 60KB-1.2MB for T-SQL transfer and >1.2MB for Win32 transfer. As I mentioned this was for a very specific case so YMMV.</p>

<p>As far as security goes I can see a number of issues with using SQL security in this way, but it's hard to offer suggestions without a little more context. You're really restricted from benefiting from Filestream by accessing it solely through T-SQL.</p>

<p>I put together a simple system so that my dad can manage a website for his club volleyball team.  He's not very familiar with html markups so I'm trying to keep this as simple as possible for him.  Here is what I have him right now:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="text_block"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;section heading&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;image src="" /&gt;  &lt;- optional image
    &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with the following css rules:</p>

<pre><code>.text_block {
padding : 1em 0;
min-height : 300px;
}
.text_block img {
float : left;
padding : 0 25px 15px 0;
}
.text_block p {
text-align : justify;
padding : 0 1.5em;
}
</code></pre>

<p>without the min-height declaration on the wrapper div I get messes like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100801-dcb4x7uw41gkn48x1fdahys994.jpg" alt="Messy paragraphs">.</p>

<p>since some of the images don't have much text in their div wrap.</p>

<p>When I DO include the min-height element we get big gaps where there are small paragraphs and no images.  Worst case scenario I could have him tag the "text_block" divs as "text_block has_image" for those with images, but I would like to keep this as simple as possible.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me out with this?  It would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>For some reason, one of my models in rails is returning nil when I call .new. This is only a problem in the controller. When I try on the console, it returns an object with nil attributes as I would expect. I suspect the problem is in my controller, but I have no idea. </p>

<p>This also happens when I call .all. Again, I can execute these commands manually from the command line without issue.</p>

<p>Here's the controller code:</p>

<p><a href="http://gist.github.com/502816" rel="nofollow">http://gist.github.com/502816</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Looks like a few of my other models are acting the same way. This problem is clearly deeper than this controller/model. I'm still very new to rails, so I'm not sure where to look to debug this.</p>

<p>EDIT2: A wise friend of mine helped me figure out that the controller action isn't even being called. My before filter, however, is, but it is not redirecting. So somehow, the right controller is found, but the appropriate action isn't called.</p>

<p>My server log <em>SAYS</em> the right action is being processed, but the actual function body doesn't seem to execute.</p>

<p>You're sleeping on the main UI thread, which stops the operating system from handling your application's events. This will stop your app from redrawing and as you discovered, can prevent new windows from actually appearing.</p>

<p>Instead of sleeping, try this:</p>

<pre><code>final ProgressDialog dialog = ProgressDialog.show(
    SettingsActivity.this, "", "Doing stuff...", true);
new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
      dialog.hide();
    }
  }, 2000);
</code></pre>

<p>I suggest that you put your objects in sets and then use an intersection of the sets:</p>

<pre><code>// Considering you put your objects in setA and setB

Set&lt;Object&gt; intersection = new HashSet&lt;Object&gt;(setA);
intersection.retainAll(setB);
</code></pre>

<p>After that you can use removeAll to get a difference to any of the two sets:</p>

<pre><code>setA.removeAll(intersection);
setB.removeAll(intersection);
</code></pre>

<p>Hi to all,</p>

<p>I've created a web application, and now i want to build some REST APIs to make it programmable by third party developers. Then, i want to build some client libraries in some popular languages (JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, etc) to make devs confortable using my service by avoiding them to parse by hand the JSON response of each request.</p>

<p>I've never built an API infrastructure before, so i have the following question.
I'd like to track the usage of the APIs methods called by third party developers. Each developer, before consuming the APIs, must be registered and so i want to associate each request to the registered developer (and so, set some specific usage limits, etc).</p>

<p>I thought to create an unique api key for each developer that he could use into all his apps, to authenticate the requests. But then i realized that if he decides to use my javascript wrapper, then malicious users could view the source code of the client app page and grab his api key.
So, i decided that it would be better to create a unique api key for every application, associated to the domain where the client app would be hosted. So that even if a user grabs someone else key, then it would be useless outside the domain where it was originally registered.
But then i thought: what about mobile apps? What happens if the call is made not from a website? How can i authenticate the key through its domain if there's no domain or the IP address is not static?</p>

<p>Any tips?<br /></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Sadly no pure HTML/CSS way to do it as neither is geared to perform calculations like that.  However, it's pretty simple with a snippet of jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>$('img.toResizeClass').each(function(){
    var imgWidth = $(this).width();
    var imgHeight = $(this).height();

    if(imgWidth &gt; imgHeight){
        $(this).width(imgWidth * 0.3);
    } else {
        $(this).height(imgHeight * 0.3);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to look at this article for more information:</p>

<p><a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/set.html" rel="nofollow">http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/set.html</a></p>

<p>As was mentioned, <code>removeAll()</code> is made for this, but you will want to do it twice, so that you can create a list of all that are missing in both, and then you could combine these two results to have a list of all the differences.</p>

<p>But, this is a destructive operation, so if you don't want to lose the information, copy the <code>Set</code> and operate on that one.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>It appears that my assumption of what is in the array is wrong, so <code>removeAll()</code> won't work, but with a 5ms requirement, depeending on the number of items to search it could be a problem.</p>

<p>So, it would appear a <code>HashMap&lt;String, Animal&gt;</code> would be the best option, as it is fast in searching.</p>

<p>Animal is an interface with at least one property, <code>String name</code>. For each class that implements <code>Animal</code> write code for <code>Equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code>. You can find some discussion here: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp05273.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp05273.html</a>.  This way, if you want the hash value to be a combination of the type of animal and the name then that will be fine.</p>

<p>So, the basic algorithm is to keep everything in the hashmaps, and then to search for differences, just get an array of keys, and search through to see if that key is contained in the other list, and if it isn't put it into a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>, storing the value there.
You will want to do this twice, so, if you have at least a dual-core processor, you may get some benefit out of having both searches being done in separate threads, but then you will want to use one of the concurrent datatypes added in JDK5 so that you don't have to worry about synchronizations in the combined list of differences.</p>

<p>So, I would write it first as a single-thread and test, to get some ideas as to how much faster it is, also comparing it to the original implmemntation.
Then, if you need it faster, try using threads, again, compare to see if there is a speed increase.</p>

<p>Before making any optimization ensure you have some metrics on what you already have, so that you can compare and see if the one change will lead to an increase in speed. </p>

<p>If you make too many changes at a time, one may have a large improvement on speed, but others may lead to a performance decrease, and it wouldn't be seen, which is why each change should be one at a time.</p>

<p>Don't lose the other implementations though, by using unit tests and testing perhaps 100 times each, you can get an idea as to what improvement each change gives you.</p>

<p>Your <code>.text_block</code> isn't <a href="http://work.arounds.org/clearing-floats/" rel="nofollow">clearing the floats</a>, set <code>overflow:hidden; zoom:1;</code> and remove the min height. That should set you straight. </p>

<p>You can alternatively set <code>clear:both;</code> so it clears the floats above. The reason why I'd go with the former is because when you inspect the element, since it's clearing itself the dimensions/bordering by the inspecting tool ( Firebug and such ) will look "right." Of course visually it doesn't really matter but I like it that way.</p>
^^
<p>Use the clear property on the text_block class:</p>

<pre><code>.text_block { clear: both; }

It's just that now I have to implement with limelight network's API and I have to start from scratch... Here's what I want to do after receiving a callback, posted to a PHP page I make:</p>

<p>Grab the XML in its raw form and send it to myself in an email so I can analyze what I'm working with.</p>

<p>No code yet, just an email function... the question is: how can I extract the XML from the post?  I'm sure I would need to make a handler, but I'm not certain where to start. Please advise.  Thanks!</p>
^^
<p>You can wrap the ajax request in a function and return false. Then you can click it and it wont take you away. For example, I have a function that looks like this</p>

<pre><code>$('.flag-commentflag a').click(function() {
    var url = $(this).attr('href');
    $.get (url, function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    });
 return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Where .flag-commentflag is the class of the div surrounding the link.</p>
^^
<p>If I've understood the question properly, then here's my evaluation of your options:</p>

<p>1) It's probably a bit nasty to have to match the (presumably arbitrarily complex?) tableau out from underneath the constructor in order to write that function.  This approach seems somewhat brittle, although it would probably work just fine.</p>

<p>2) I don't see the need to generalise the pattern out, given that it's a recursive function operating on a recursive structure.  Introducing a higher-order pattern would (I think) obfuscate the actual logic behind performing a recursive traversal of this data structure.</p>

<p>3) I think this makes a good deal of sense.  As you've observed, it's a reasonably recognised "pattern", but I think it matches the description of the algorithm well to write it down in exactly this way.  It may not be as generalisable or reusable, but given that it's essentially the crux of the algorithmic approach, I think it makes sense to write the cases directly as you have done in a function like f.  This would be my favoured approach.</p>

<p>Sorry to not provide a particularly concrete answer, but it is a reasonably subjective answer, so given the three options above, I would pick option 3 for reasons of clarity and readability.</p>
^^
<p>I have a serialized object which needs to be sent as an encrypted XML string. I am able to save the serialized object to a well-formed XML file, but this is not what I want. I have already got Rijndael encrypt/decrypt working for a sample string.</p>

<pre><code>Person person = new Person("Irish", "Chieftain");
XmlSerializer xmlSerializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Person));

// Write serialized XML to file
System.Guid guid = System.Guid.NewGuid();
StreamWriter streamWriter 
    = new StreamWriter(@"C:\application" + "_" + guid.ToString() + ".xml")
xmlSerializer.Serialize(streamWriter.BaseStream, person);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>I want to be able to display the XML string in the browser</strong>, before encryption, to test that the correct encrypted string is being sent to the decrypt method on the other machine.</p>

<p>I have been beating on this for a week and have looked to other answers on SO, such as:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/543319/how-to-return-xml-in-asp-net">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/543319/how-to-return-xml-in-asp-net</a></p>

<p>Can anyone show me the correct syntax to display the generated XML as a string in the browser?</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong>
Here is what I'm trying to render the XML:</p>

<pre><code>MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
XmlTextWriter xmlWriter2 = new XmlTextWriter(memoryStream, Encoding.UTF8); 
xmlWriter2.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;
xmlSerializer.Serialize(xmlWriter2, person);
memoryStream = (MemoryStream) xmlWriter2.BaseStream;
UTF8Encoding encoding2 = new UTF8Encoding();
stringData = encoding2.GetString(memoryStream.ToArray());
Response.ContentType = "text/xml";
Response.Write(stringData);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 2]</strong></p>

<p>If I remove the "text/xml" content type, I get the following when I view source (is this correct?):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;Person xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"&gt;
  &lt;FirstName&gt;Irish&lt;/FirstName&gt;
  &lt;SecondName&gt;Chieftain&lt;/SecondName&gt;
&lt;/Person&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[Update 3]</strong></p>

<p>Working version:</p>

<pre><code>            #region Display original string
            // Write serialized XML to a string - Display purposes.
            MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
            XmlTextWriter xmlWriter2 
                = new XmlTextWriter(memoryStream, Encoding.UTF8);
            xmlWriter2.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;
            xmlSerializer.Serialize(xmlWriter2, person);
            memoryStream = (MemoryStream) xmlWriter2.BaseStream;
            UTF8Encoding encoding2 = new UTF8Encoding();
            stringData = encoding2.GetString(memoryStream.ToArray());

            Response.Clear();
            Response.ContentType = "text/xml";
            Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);
            Response.Cache.SetAllowResponseInBrowserHistory(true);
            Response.Write(stringData);
            Response.End();
            #endregion

<p>I use <code>MPMoviePlayerViewController</code> to make a moviePlayer.  But, when I click the "done" button, or cancel the player, the memory used always increases.  Why??</p>
^^
<p>I'm trying to split an HTML string by a token in order to create a blog preview without displaying the full post. It's a little <em>harder</em> than I first thought. Here are the problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>A user will be creating the HTML
through a WYSIWYG editor (CKEditor).
The markup isn't guaranteed to be
pretty or consistent.</li>
<li>The token, <code>read_more()</code>, can
be placed anywhere in the string,
including being nested within a
paragraph tag.</li>
<li>The resulting first split string
needs to be valid HTML for all
reasonable uses of the token.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of possible uses:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Some text here. read_more()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some text read more() here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;read_more()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  read_more()&lt;/p&gt;

read_more()
</code></pre>

<p>So far, I've tried just splitting the string on the token, but it leaves invalid HTML. Regex is perhaps another option. What strategy would you use to solve this and make it as bulletproof as possible? Any code snippets or hints would also be appreciated (I'm using PHP).</p>
^^
<p>Sure. In the PHP part you can use the bitwise operator <code>^</code>, but you'll first have to convert the string into an array of integers (e.g. <code>array_map('ord', str_split($str))</code>) and then do an inner product with the one-time pad, xor taking the role of multiplication and concatenation taking the role of addition.</p>

<p>Remember that if you re-use the pad, the security of the encryption falls apart.</p>
^^
<p>If the only user affected by the CSS is the user that provided the CSS, then there's not much of a risk. Any XSS vulnerability could only affect the user.</p>

<p>Some browsers allow users to use custom CSS anyway, or ignore it altogether, so I wouldn't consider it a problem.</p>
^^
<p>The problem is that since your container div is not floated, it is being pushed over by the image when the p tags don't take up enough space.</p>

<p>You could float the container divs as well to make everything stay inside (though this might give you some issues with whatever contains your container divs)</p>

<p>The other option would be to add some kind of clearing div at the end of each container</p>

<pre><code>div.clear {
  float:none;
  clear:both;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>suppose <code>$my_ref = \$hash{'mary'};</code> <code>#my_ref</code> is a reference point to a hash element.<br>
....<br>
later on, how can I use <code>$my_ref</code> to retrieve the key of the hash element it point to? i.e how to get string 'mary' from <code>$my_ref</code>?</p>

<p>I ask this question because I have several groups of user name list, some user names appear in multiple groups which consumes memory. So I decide to create a common user name list, and let these groups only store the reference to the corresponding user name rather than user name.   </p>

<p>e.g. originally,  </p>

<pre><code>%group1 = {'mary'=&gt;1, 'luke'=1,'tom'=1,...}  
%group2 = {'mary'=&gt;1, 'sam'=1,'tom'=1,...}
</code></pre>

<p>Here you see 'mary' and 'tom' are shown in both <code>group1</code> and <code>group2</code> which consume memory. (note I do not care the value in this example, the value is here only because the data struct is a hash). So to reduce memory, I want to have a common list stores all user names:   </p>

<pre><code>%common_hash = {'mary'=&gt;1, 'luke'=1,'tom'=1,'sam'=1...};  
$ref1 = \$common_hash{'mary'};  
$ref2 = \$common_hash{'luke'};  
$ref3 = \$common_hash{'tom'};  
$ref4 = \$common_hash{'sam'};
</code></pre>

<p>groups only store the reference of the hash element:  </p>

<pre><code>%group1 = {$ref1=&gt;1, $ref2=1,$ref3=1,...};  
%group2 = {$ref1=&gt;1, $ref4=1,$ref3=1,...}; 
</code></pre>

<p>I think this approach can save much memory because:</p>

<ol>
<li>one user name is store in memory once not multiple times;</li>
<li>groups stores reference (an integer) rather than string (in my case, the length of each user name is 30 bytes in average, while each integer is only 4 bytes (32 bit sys.) or 8 bytes (64 bit sys.)) (BTW, correct me if an integer does not use 4 bytes or 8 bytes.)</li>
<li>using reference I can access user name immediately without looking for it.</li>
</ol>

<p>But how can I get the user name from a group?  </p>

<p>If I use <code>@my_ref = keys %group1</code>, I think I will get value of 'mary',but not 'mary'.      </p>

<pre><code>$result = $($my_ref[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>It can be done from assembly, but it isn't easy.  You can't use int 21h, that's a DOS system call and it isn't available under Linux.</p>

<p>To get characters from the terminal under UNIX-like operating systems (such as Linux), you read from STDIN (file number 0).  Normally, the read system call will block until the user presses enter.  This is called canonical mode.  To read a single character without waiting for the user to press enter, you must first disable canonical mode.  Of course, you'll have to re-enable it if you want line input later on, and before your program exits.</p>

<p>To disable canonical mode on Linux, you send an IOCTL (IO ControL) to STDIN, using the ioctl syscall.  I assume you know how to make Linux system calls from assembler.</p>

<p>The ioctl syscall has three parameters.  The first is the file to send the command to (STDIN), the second is the IOCTL number, and the third is typically a pointer to a data structure.  ioctl returns 0 on success, or a negative error code on fail.</p>

<p>The first IOCTL you need is TCGETS (number 0x5401) which gets the current terminal parameters in a termios structure.  The third parameter is a pointer to a termios structure.  From the kernel source, the termios structure is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>struct termios {
    tcflag_t c_iflag;               /* input mode flags */
    tcflag_t c_oflag;               /* output mode flags */
    tcflag_t c_cflag;               /* control mode flags */
    tcflag_t c_lflag;               /* local mode flags */
    cc_t c_line;                    /* line discipline */
    cc_t c_cc[NCCS];                /* control characters */
};
</code></pre>

<p>where tcflag_t is 32 bits long, cc_t is one byte long, and NCCS is currently defined as 19.  See the NASM manual for how you can conveniently define and reserve space for structures like this.</p>

<p>So once you've got the current termios, you need to clear the canonical flag.  This flag is in the c_lflag field, with mask ICANON (0x00000002).  To clear it, compute c_lflag AND (NOT ICANON). and store the result back into the c_lflag field.</p>

<p>Now you need to notify the kernel of your changes to the termios structure.  Use the TCSETS (number 0x5402) ioctl, with the third parameter set the the address of your termios structure.</p>

<p>If all goes well, the terminal is now in non-canonical mode.  You can restore canonical mode by setting the canonical flag (by ORing c_lflag with ICANON) and calling the TCSETS ioctl again. <strong>always restore canonical mode before you exit</strong></p>

<p>As I said, it isn't easy.</p>
^^
<p>Perhaps A.f(String) should be A.f(CharSequence) instead.  You can mock a CharSequence.</p>

<p>I'm following a tutorial from chapter 12 of the book "Beginning iPhone 3 Development." When I try to build the project I get an error. The book came with the project files, so I went through every file in my Classes directory and copied and pasted the code from the example project so that they are identical. This has solved my build errors in the past. I checked that the same frameworks were installed and the files in the Other Sources and Resources folder are identical. Still, when I try to build, I get the following build error:</p>

<p>From what I can see my project is identical to the one supplied with the book, which I can build and run successfully. What could possibly still be different that is causing this error?</p>

<p>Hello, </p>

<p>I am getting an infinite loop in the URL redirect after a user either logs in or is already logged in. The page redirects to the login page if the user is not logged in as expected , but goes in the loop as soon as he enters the credentials. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

include_once ('facebook.php');
  $api_key = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx';
  $secret  = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx';

  $facebook = new Facebook($api_key, $secret);
$facebook-&gt;require_frame();
$uid = $facebook-&gt;require_login($required_permissions = 'email,status_update,offline_access');
$facebook-&gt;api_client-&gt;users_hasAppPermission("offline_access",$uid);

  #   echo "&lt;p&gt;Your status has been updated&lt;/p&gt;";

</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly this code was working before, but suddenly started giving me an infinite loop problem. There have been couple of discussion on facebook forum about this but no indication that is a bug or what is the workaround . </p>

<p>Any help would be highly appreciateed. </p>

<p>I'm creating a time-series object with new variables using the transform() function in R and cannot find the proper function to calculate the difference in variable C between today and yesterday.</p>

<p>This is what I've got so far:</p>

<pre><code>                 O       H       L       C  Typical Range

<p>The next row will be added with the following function:</p>

<pre><code>SPX &lt;- transform(SPX, Return = (C - C(yesterday) ) / C(yesterday)))

<p>Hello guys...</p>

<p>I'm working on a Flex 4 application and I started customizing the interface with skins to give a whole new look.</p>

<p>So, I've created two scrollbar skins in Flash Catalyst (one horizontal, one vertical).</p>

<p>Its working great when I test the application through Catalyst so I took it and imported it on Flash Builder, copied the components and defined the new skins in my css file for the HScrollbar and VScrollbar.</p>

<p>The skin is working, all the buttons are ok. But, the scrollbar isnt resizing for some reason. It remains in the same height I've designed it to be regardless of the content it is bound to.</p>

<p>It scrolls the content in all the ways it should be but it doesnt resize and the thumb isnt getting all the way down.</p>

<p>Also I've noticed the following.</p>

<p>I have a custom component acting as a list. It extends Group and contains a Scroller. So at one place of the application the Scrollthumb is getting lower than on another place where the same custom list is used.</p>

<p>I also have to mention that this scroller works perfectly without a custom skin.</p>

<p>Anyone else having similar problems?</p>

<p>I've spent most of my career writing applications for consumption within small to medium sized organizations.  In those roles, I'd relied on regular expressions to validate the user's input (e.g. email, zipcode, phone # or to find and remove unwanted markup) and the  AntiXSS library to protected against cross site scripting attacks.</p>

<p>After reading (ok, trolling) through the posts here, and after reading them I'm wondering that if what I am currently doing is enough, especially as more of my projects are becoming more outward facing.  </p>

<p>My question is this:  Is there are good tutorial with examples on best practices to sanitize user input?  I found this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa973813.aspx" rel="nofollow">article</a> and this which deals with the XSS library and this <a href="http://refactormycode.com/codes/333-sanitize-html" rel="nofollow">thread</a> on RefactorMyCode - I don't want to rely on just one facet to protect the site.</p>

<p>Any help/advice would be useful.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>function stripmore($in)

    list($p1,$p2) = explode("read_more()",$in,2);

    }

    return $p1."read_more()".$pass3;
}
</code></pre>

<p>this strips any non-html after the read_more() mark, and reduces it to the minimum by stripping corresponding tags, while keeping any tag starting before and ending after the mark:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Some text here. read_more()&lt;/p&gt;
      ==&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some text here. read_more()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt; read_more() &lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      ==&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some &lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt; read_more()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;b&gt;text read_more() here&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      ==&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some &lt;b&gt;text read_more()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

^^
<p>Why not use two textareas?  One above and below the cut?  The should make it obvious to the user what's going on, and eliminate the headache for you.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> want to use a token, you should choose something a bit more distinctive.  Maybe:  <code>&lt;!--full body cut--&gt;</code> which you can be somewhat more sure isn't actually content being mistaken for a token.</p>

<p>Anyhow, if you want to split the string on the token, you just need to figure out where your token <em>is</em> using <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.strpos.php" rel="nofollow"><code>strpos()</code></a> and then use <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.substr.php" rel="nofollow"><code>substr()</code></a> to chop off the first part.  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>$intro = substr($text, 0, strpos($string, $token));
</code></pre>

<p>Following that, run your <code>$intro</code> through <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/book.tidy.php" rel="nofollow">tidy</a> (PHP extension) to <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/tidy.cleanrepair.php" rel="nofollow">clean up the syntax</a> and then strip off the extra crap it adds in there.  (I think you can <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.str-replace.php" rel="nofollow">str_replace()</a> the extras with an empty string.)</p>
^^
<p>The only correct option I currently see is writing your own context-free grammar HTML parser in PHP which will allow you to close the tags appropriately (simply by popping the stack when reaching read more() and for each pop adding a closing tag). <br /><br />
This is, however, a lot of work and this might work well for you:</p>

<pre><code>$stripped = strip_tags($input);
list($preview) = explode("read more()", $stripped);
</code></pre>

<p>You lose the HTML markup but it's dead easy to implement. And no possible XSS on your front page :)</p>

<p>Ok so I have a little test program here:</p>

    &lt;signal name="delete_event" handler="endProgram" /&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;

<p>I then use this:</p>

<pre><code>def endProgram ():
    print "end";

rofl = gtk.Builder();

rofl.add_from_file("mainwindow.ui");
win = rofl.get_object("mainWindow");
rofl.connect_signals("mainWindow");
win.show_all();
gtk.main();

<p>Yet when I go to run that it complains that I am missing a handler for the mainWindow object.
I have tried doing     rofl.connect_signals(win); as well</p>

<p>Yes indeed.  There is a non-standard, but recognized <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/The_autocomplete_attribute_and_web_documents_using_XHTML" rel="nofollow">autocomplete attribute</a> that can be applied to form elements.</p>

<p>Check in your HTML for something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="password" name="the-password" id="the-password" autocomplete="off"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It can also be set by Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>var thePassword = document.getElementById('the-password');
thePassword.setAttribute("autocomplete", "off");

Our system is designed such there is an ETL process that runs which takes operational data and updates the database (this is a read database).Given that the ETL can do some heavy lifting based on email address being changed (Email address is just an example), how do we sync up reporting database (DataMart and the operational side) as the user wants to see the email address update immediately in the screen?</p>

<p>I use mysqli extension and bind the result to an object:</p>

<pre><code>class Item {
    public $id, $name;
    }
$Item = new Item;
$stmt-&gt;bind_result($Item-&gt;id, $Item-&gt;name);
</code></pre>

<p>Every call to <code>$stmt-&gt;fetch()</code> will overwrite $Item's properties which became references. If I simply clone the object — these references remain and both instances change simultaneously:</p>

<pre><code>object(Item)#1 (2) {
  ["id"]=&gt;
  &amp;int(1)
  ["name"]=&gt;
  &amp;string(4) "name"
}
</code></pre>

<p>So there should be a way to dereference them so <code>clone</code> really makes a copy, not a set of referenced data. Is there a simple, flexible way to retrieve all the data so it's stored as an array of objects? The main problem is how to remove the references: <code>&amp;string</code>.</p>

<p>The only solution I see is to instantiate another object and manually copy all the properties:</p>

<pre><code>$Item2 = new Item;
foreach ($Item as $prop =&gt; $val)
    $Item2-&gt;$prop = $val;
</code></pre>

<p>but this seems to be an overkill: it will copy all properties (including some extra ones which were not actually referenced) which is not necessary, and moreover — is a penalty to the performance.</p>

<p>Instead of using full HTML, why not use one of the many markup languages that can generate HTML, but which don't require you to close tags, etc.  It would be easier to train your users, and would avoid all of the possibilities for XSS attacks that accepting raw HTML allows.</p>

<p>Per <a href="http://www.pygtk.org/docs/pygtk/class-gtkbuilder.html#method-gtkbuilder--connect-signals" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>, <code>connect_signals</code> takes as the argument a mapping or instance, and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>uses Python's introspective features
  to look at the keys (if object is a
  mapping) or attributes (if object is
  an instance) and tries to match them
  with the signal handler names given in
  the interface description. The
  callbacks referenced by each matched
  key or attribute are connected to
  their matching signals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for example when you pass <code>"mainwindow"</code>, which is an instance of <code>str</code>, the attributes are e.g. such method names as <code>upper</code>, <code>lower</code>, <code>isalpha</code>, and the like -- nothing to do with anything at all that you might be remotely interested about.  And why would you want the attributes of <code>win</code> to handle signals, either?  IOW, what do you expect <code>connect_signals</code> to <strong>do</strong>?</p>

<p>A more typical example use can be found e.g. in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2129369/gtk-builder-and-multiple-glade-files-breaks">SO question</a> and <a href="http://www.micahcarrick.com/gtk-glade-tutorial-part-3.html" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a>, which offers among others the following Python example:</p>

<pre><code>class TutorialTextEditor:

    def on_window_destroy(self, widget, data=None):
        gtk.main_quit()

    def __init__(self):

        builder = gtk.Builder()
        builder.add_from_file("tutorial.xml") 

        self.window = builder.get_object("window")
        builder.connect_signals(self)     
</code></pre>

<p>as you see, here <code>connect_signals</code> is used in the typical way -- i.e., passing an object (<code>self</code>) with an <code>on_window_destroy</code> method that (by introspection) will be used as the handler for the signal raised on window destruction.</p>

<p>You may want to use a "slug" instead.  Rather than using the verbatim title as the URL, you <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.strtolower.php" rel="nofollow"><code>strtolower()</code></a> and replace all non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens, then remove duplicate hyphens.  If you feel like extra credit, you can strip out <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/fulltext-stopwords.html" rel="nofollow">stopwords</a>, too.</p>

<p>So "1-As Low As 10% Downpayment, Free Golf Membership!!!" becomes:</p>

<p><code>as-low-as-10-downpayment-free-gold-membership</code></p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function sluggify($url)
{
    # Prep string with some basic normalization
    $url = strtolower($url);
    $url = strip_tags($url);
    $url = stripslashes($url);
    $url = html_entity_decode($url);

    # Remove quotes (can't, etc.)
    $url = str_replace('\'', '', $url);

    # Replace non-alpha numeric with hyphens
    $match = '/[^a-z0-9]+/';
    $replace = '-';
    $url = preg_replace($match, $replace, $url);

    $url = trim($url, '-');

    return $url;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could probably shorten it with longer regexps but it's pretty straightforward as-is.  The bonus is that you can use the same function to validate the query parameter before you run a query on the database to match the title, so someone can't stick silly things into your database.</p>

<p>Sorry, hashes don't work that way.  You aren't saving any memory by using a reference instead of a string as a hash key, and furthermore you are 1. making it harder to find data in the has (it is obscured) 2. getting in the way of Perl's internal hash optimizations (using a <em>hash algorithm</em> to provide O(1) lookup inside what is effectively a list).  In either case, the hash key is a <em>scalar</em>, which needs to be stored somewhere.  By using a reference as the hash key, now you not only need to store the reference in the hash, but also the value it is referencing, so you are now using <em>more</em> memory.</p>

<p>What led you to believe that you were saving memory by your, <em>cough</em>, novel approach? Have you run a memory profiler against different implementations?</p>

<p>Generally, you cannot get from a hash's <em>value</em> back to its <em>key</em> (although you could traverse the hash table linearly looking for it, if it were unique).  If you want to keep track of both a hash key and value, you need to do it yourself.  Some common approaches are:</p>

<pre><code># iterate through the table by key
foreach my $key (keys %hash)
{
     # here we have both the key and its corresponding value
     print "value at key $key is $hash{$key}\n";
}

# iterate through the table by keys and values
while (my ($key, $value) = each %hash)
{
     print "value at key $key is $value, which is the same as $hash{$key}\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>An alternative is to store your value as an integer number of cents (which is always an exact amount, no rounding), and then convert to dollars when displaying for reports using divmod:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; value_in_cents = 133
&gt;&gt;&gt; print "$%d.%d" % divmod(value_in_cents,100)
$1.33

<p>The way I see it, the components in Flex and the ability to create a custom component that fits your exact needs (and all of this is done by a fully object oriented approach) cant be matched by the AJAX frameworks. The AMF protocol is also a big advantage since its amazingly fast. The animations are easily created to give each component a feeling that enhances the user experience and can give to your interface a life of its own. Everything mentioned before my post also should be considered.</p>

<p>The open source solutions are there to use them whenever its right, and I would also use it if I wanted to build a simple site with some server side code perhaps.</p>

<p>But when you pass from the "website" and get to the "web application" then I think that in order to be successful you have to create material that stands out. Flex is there exactly for that.</p>

<p>If you can build the same experience without it go ahead and do it, good for you. :)</p>

<p>No. This is because Silverlight (like Flash) thinks of itself as an "application", not a "document".

Silverlight incorrectly uses the word "embed" where it actually "links" instead.</p>

<p>Like any good technology though, it may be possible to reverse engineer an EOT file though - these security guys did it using IE: <a href="http://securitylabs.websense.com/content/Blogs/3114.aspx" rel="nofollow">Reverse Engineering the Embedded OpenType Decompression</a>.

Or maybe you could look at this ttf-to-eot converter and do the reverse: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ttf2eot/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/ttf2eot/</a></p>

<p>I spent a fair amount of time trying to determine why my view of a site didn't match a clients, after looking at the cache etc. we determined the problem to be with one of the add-ons (Adblock Plus in this particular case).

Is there anyway to generate a list programmatically perhaps with JavaScript?</p>

<p>In order to answer a comment to my comment I decided to have it be an answer, so I can take advantage of the markup options.</p>

<p>Why can't you just use trim() on the resulting string, find the missing open or close element and append that appropriately, to make it valid HTML? </p>

<p>Just traverse forward and back to find the next open/close element, and fix your HTML. </p>

<p>So, you can just walk forward and back in the string to get the next <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>, and if that is an HTML element then stop there, otherwise keep going.</p>

<p>Ideally you should need to process this once per submission, so you keep paying the price to do this operation.</p>

However, the workaround provided will not work for my app. Let me re-state the problem so that you don't have to go read another question:</p>

<p>I am trying to select all the text in a textarea when it gets focus. The following jQuery code works in IE/FF/Opera:</p>

<pre><code>$('#out').focus(function(){
  $('#out').select();
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, in Chrome/Safari the text is selected--very briefly--but then the mouseUp event is fired and the text is deselected. The following workaround is offered in the above links:</p>

<pre><code>$('#out').mouseup(function(e){
  e.preventDefault();
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, <strong>this workaround is no good for me</strong>. I want to select all text <em>only</em> when the user gives the textarea focus. He <em>must</em> then be able to select only part of the text if he chooses. Can anyone think of a workaround that still meets this requirement?</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, you are trying to heuristically extract URLs from HTML files, from both attributes (e.g. "href") and text.</p>

<ul>
<li>You want it to work with malformed HTML</li>
<li>You want it to work with malformed URLs; e.g. URLs containing spaces</li>
<li>You don't want it to make any mistakes; e.g. your example.</li>
</ul>

<p>I put it to you that your requirements are impossible.  For example, what <em>should</em> be extracted from the following text:</p>

<pre><code>Go to the URL http://example.com/ this and that.  And if that doesn't work, 
I recommend that you go read the http specification.
</code></pre>

<p>Is "this and that" supposed to be part of the URL, or not?  And how is your software supposed to figure this out?  And what if the author of the document meant the opposite to what your heuristic says?  And what about "http specification" ... which is clearly NOT a URL.</p>

<p>And here's another, slightly more subtle example:</p>

<pre><code>First, go to the URL http://example.com/index.html.
Then click on the "login" link.
</code></pre>

<p>Should your software extract "http://example.com/index.html." or "http://example.com/index.html"?  According to the URL specification, both are valid URLs.  Your software would probably strip off the final "." because it is most likely to be punctuation, but it <em>might</em> be wrong.</p>

<p>My advice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't think you can do a better job than an existing permissive HTML parser.  Where you are coming from, the chances that you can are close to zero.</li>
<li>Don't think that your software won't make mistakes.  100% accuracy requires that your software can read the mind of the person who created the file.  (And arguably, even that is not sufficient.)</li>
<li>Pay attention to the context in which URLs appear.  You need to use different heuristics to extract URLs from HTML attributes and text.</li>
<li>Pay attention to exactly what is, and what is not a legal URL.</li>
<li>Fully read and understand all relevant parts of the HTML and URL/URI specifications.  While it is kind of OK to make mistakes with malformed documents, it would be unforgivable to fail to extract well-formed URLs from attributes of well-formed HTML documents.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember that the primary use of C++/CLI is for developing class libraries for consumption by GUIs / web services built in other .NET languages.  So C++/CLI has to support both reference and value types because other .NET languages do.</p>

<p>Furthermore, C# can have <code>ref</code> parameters that are value typed as well, this isn't unique to C++/CLI and it doesn't in any way make value types equivalent to reference types.</p>

<p>To answer the questions in your code comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>am I creating a copy or what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, SetValueTwo takes its parameter by value, so a copy is made.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is this copy Disposable even though value types don't have destructors?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  Value types can have destructors.  Value types cannot have finalizers.  Since this particular value type has a trivial destructor, the C++/CLI compiler will not cause it to implement IDisposable.  In any case, if a parameter is an IDisposable value type, the C++/CLI compiler will ensure that Dispose is called when the variable goes out of scope, just like stack semantics for local variables.  This includes abnormal termination (thrown exception), and allows managed types to be used with RAII.</p>

<p>Both</p>

<pre><code>ValueStruct% ref = *gcnew ValueStruct;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>ValueStruct^ ref = gcnew ValueStruct;
</code></pre>

<p>are allowed, and put a boxed value type instance on the managed heap (which isn't a heap at all, but a stack, however it is not the call stack where local variables are stored, so Microsoft chooses to call it a heap like the native memory area for dynamic allocation).</p>

<p>Unlike C#, C++/CLI can keep typed handles to boxed objects.</p>

<p>If a tracking reference is to a value type instance on the stack or embedded in another object, then the value type content has to be boxed in the process of formed the reference.</p>

<p>Tracking references can also be used with reference types, and the syntax to obtain a handle is the same:</p>

<pre><code>RefClass^ newinst = gcnew RefClass();
RefClass% reftoinst = *newinst;
RefClass^% reftohandle = newinst;

RefClass stacksem;
RefClass^ ssh = %stacksem;
</code></pre>

<p>One thing that I can never seem to remember completely is that the syntax isn't 100% consistent compared to native C++.</p>

<p>Declare a reference:</p>

<pre><code>int&amp; ri = i; // native
DateTime% dtr = dt; // managed tracking reference
</code></pre>

<p>Declare a pointer:
    int* pi; // native
    Stream^ sh; // tracking handle</p>

<p>Form a pointer:
    int* pi = &ri; // address-of native object
    DateTime^ dth = %dtr; // address-of managed object</p>

<p>Note that the unary address-of operator is the same as the pointer notation in both standard C++ and C++/CLI.  This seems to contradict <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9zekbcac.aspx" rel="nofollow">a tracking reference cannot be used as a unary take-address operator (MSDN)</a> which I'll get back to in a second.</p>

<p>First though, the inconsistency:</p>

<p>Form a reference from a pointer:
    int&amp; iref = *pi;
    DateTime% dtref = *dth;</p>

<p>Note that the unary dereference operator is always <code>*</code>.  It is the same as the reference notation only in the native world, which is completely opposite of references which, as mentioned above, are always the same symbol as the pointer notation.</p>

<p>Compilable example:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime^ dth = gcnew DateTime();
DateTime% dtr = *dth;

DateTime dt = DateTime::Now;
DateTime^ dtbox = %dt;

FileInfo fi("temp.txt");
// FileInfo^ fih = &amp;fi;  causes error C3072
FileInfo^ fih = %fi;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, about unary address-of:</p>

<p>First, the MSDN article is wrong when it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following sample shows that a tracking reference cannot be used as a unary take-address operator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The correct statement is:</p>

<p><strong><code>%</code> is the address-of operator for creation of a tracking handle.  However its use is limited as follows:</strong></p>

<p>A tracking handle must point to an object on the managed heap.  Reference types always exist on the managed heap so there is no problem.  However, value types and native types may be on the stack (for local variables) or embedded within another object (member variables of value type).  Attempts to form a tracking handle will form a handle to a boxed copy of the variable: the handle is not linked to the original variable.  As a consequence of the boxing process, which requires metadata which does not exist for native types, it is never possible to have a tracking handle to an instance of a native type.</p>

<p>Example code:</p>

<pre><code>int i = 5;
// int^ ih = %i;  causes error C3071

System::Int32 si = 5;
// System::Int32^ sih = %si; causes error C3071
// error C3071: operator '%' can only be applied to an instance 
//              of a ref class or a value-type
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>System::Int32</code> isn't a value type then I don't know what is.  Let's try <code>System::DateTime</code> which is a non-primitive value type:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime dt = DateTime::Now;
DateTime^ dtbox = %dt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works!</p>

<p>As a further unfortunate restriction, primitive types which have dual identity (e.g. native <code>int</code> and managed value type <code>System::Int32</code>) are not handled correctly, the <code>%</code> (form tracking reference) operator cannot perform boxing <em>even when the .NET name for the type is given</em>.</p>
^^
<p>Make a <code>bool</code>. Set it to <code>true</code> after a focus event and reset it after a mouse up event. During the mouse up, if it's <code>true</code>, you know the user just selected the text field; therefore you know you must prevent the mouse up from happening. Otherwise, you must let it pass.</p>

<pre><code>var textFieldGotFocus = false;

$('#out').focus(function()
{
    $('#out').select();
    textFieldGotFocus = true;
});

$('#out').mouseup(function(e)
{
    if (textFieldGotFocus)
        e.preventDefault();
});

$(document).mouseup(function() { textFieldGotFocus = false; });
</code></pre>

<p>It's important that you put the mouseup listener that resets the variable on <code>document</code>, since it's not guaranteed that the user will release the mouse button over the text field.</p>

<p>I have installed the WAMP server on my local machine, and would like to use it in "Put Online" mode to share the work with clients.  I have it working with the IP address, but when I click on a PHP file in the localhost, the basic HTML displays, but the CSS doesn't seem to work.  The CSS is connected through a relative path, but it won't display the styles.</p>

<p>I have set up WAMP to display multiple websites within the www/ folder.  I didn't know if this had something to do with it or not. </p>

<p>Any help on this matter would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>You can click the "persist" button on the net tab. (and other tabs)  Was a real "oh duh" moment for me when I noticed it.</p>

<p>Sure, not a problem.  You can use position: absolute to move a link up over the image:</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="img"&gt;
    &lt;img src="your-img.jpg"/&gt;
    &lt;a href="your-img.jpg" class="full-size"&gt;View Full Sized&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>CSS</strong></p>

<pre><code>#post .img {
   position: relative;
}

#post img {
   max-height: 1000px;
   max-width: 700px;

   position: relative;
   z-index: 1;
}

#post a.full-size {
   position: absolute;
   z-index: 2;

   /* Change this to move the link around */
   top: 0px;
   left: 0px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason you need the extra <code>&lt;div class="img"&gt;</code> is so there's a relatively positioned parent for the absolutely positioned link.  This causes the link to use its parent as its coordinate system, rather than the document.</p>

<p>I have a very simple image upload web app. There's only upload and image crop. Everything worked fine. I have not made any changes to the code or anything. Today I visit my site and the submit button has vanished. I thought maybe I was hacked. I tried the version of my site that I have on my own machine running in IIS and the button is also missing. How could the submit button just vanish? I even tested other versions of my site I had saved and stored in rar files on my computer. Any idea of what happened? The web page is a .aspx page. The code for the button is still there. The same way it's always been. The graphic is still there. Now I'd maybe believe someone gained access to my server and did this as a joke but I also tested my site running in IIS on my own computer and I still got the same result. No submit button. So someone would have had to gained access to my server and computer and changed every copy of the site I saved on my computer too which doesn't seem likely to me. Only the submit button is gone. Everything else is fine.</p>

<p>Google will modify any resource you give it by adding a random identifier to the end.</p>

<p>If you're writing both the sender and the receiver, try using an XMPP extension:</p>

<p>Say you have a Post model that has a <code>:title</code>, <code>:author</code>, <code>:content</code>, etc. It also has a <code>:thread_id</code> attribute, and it <code>belongs_to :thread</code>.</p>

<p>The thread model doesn't have any custom fields. The only ones you'll be needing are those created by default such as <code>:id</code>, <code>:created_at</code>, and <code>:updated_at</code>. Threads <code>have_many :posts</code>.</p>

<p>How do you create a form for a Thread that simultaneously creates both a Thread and a Post?</p>

<p>Related questions, possibly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I say <code>&lt;% form_for @new_thread ... %&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;% form_for @new_post ... %&gt;</code>?</li>

<p>Hi, I have a mysql query as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *, MATCH(songtitle) AGAINST('{keyword}') as Relevance FROM links WHERE approved = "true" AND MATCH(songtitle) AGAINST('{keyword}' IN BOOLEAN MODE) ORDER BY Relevance DESC, score DESC LIMIT 5
</code></pre>

<p>This works generally as expected, but for certain queries it will not return the right results. It would appear to have to do with the length or alphanumeric makeup of the keyword used.</p>

<p>For example, I have a row where the value of songtitle is "Jay Z". I also have several containing the name "Jay Sean"</p>

<p>Searching for "Jay" or "Jay Z" does not return any of these results. Searching for "Jay Sean" has the expected and desired result.</p>

<p>I'm guessing this has something to do with the small amount of characters in "Jay" and "jay z"?</p>

<p>Any info out there about this?</p>

<p>Thanks!

<p>Simply put - nope.  In MySQL you have to write a SP in their language or a UDF in <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/adding-udf.html" rel="nofollow">C/C++</a>. I brought up a C/C++ UDF, but I don't believe you can even really do a stored procedure in them.  </p>

<p>I'm working on implementing bezier handles into my application. I have points and I need to figure out weather the current direction of the new point is clockwise or counter clockwise. This is because my bezier interpolation algorithm calculates the handles from right to left.</p>

<p>Therefore no matter what it interpolates:
P1 P1.righthandle P2 P2.lefthandle to achieve cubic bezier</p>

<p>How can I figure out if the shape is CW or CCW. Thanks</p>
^^
<p>To answer your question directly, put <code>r</code> in front of the string.</p>

<pre><code>final= path + r'\xulrunner.exe ' + path + r'\application.ini'
</code></pre>

<p>But a better solution would be <code>os.path.join</code>:</p>

<pre><code>final = os.path.join(path, 'xulrunner.exe') + ' ' + \
         os.path.join(path, 'application.ini')
</code></pre>

<p>(the backslash there is escaping a newline, but you could put the whole thing on one line if you want)</p>

<p>I will mention that you can use forward slashes in file paths, and Python will automatically convert them to the correct separator (backslash on Windows) as necessary. So</p>

<pre><code>final = path + '/xulrunner.exe ' + path + '/application.ini'
</code></pre>

<p>should work. But it's still preferable to use <code>os.path.join</code> because that makes it clear what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>G'day,</p>

<p>I'm trying to update part of a VBO with a call to glBufferSubData(). When I update from the start (0) of my existing shadow buffer, there is no problem, as the buffer starts reading from 0. The following will read 0 to y from the buffer and place it at 0 to y in the VBO:</p>

<pre><code>gl.glBufferSubData(GL11.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0, y, mPositionBuffer);
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I want to update a portion of the VBO (not from 0) I run into a problem; The following doesn't work, since it will write the values from the start of the buffer (0 to y) into position x to x+y of the VBO:</p>

<pre><code>gl.glBufferSubData(GL11.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, x, y, mPositionBuffer);
</code></pre>

<p>Changing the position using buffer.position(x) does not have any effect:</p>

<pre><code>gl.glBufferSubData(GL11.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, x, y, mPositionBuffer.position(x));
</code></pre>

<p>A solution is to slice() the buffer, which works great:</p>

<pre><code>mPositionBuffer.position(x);
gl.glBufferSubData(GL11.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, x, y, mPositionBuffer.slice());
</code></pre>

<p>But this causes garbage since a new buffer is generated by using slice, even though it uses the same data store.</p>

<p>The question: Is there a way to get the desired result (replace an offset part of a VBO using an offset into a buffer) without generating garbage? As you probably guessed, this is for an android game and in-game garbage collection is a no-no.</p>

<p>Thanks! Aert.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be too hard to do yourself.  SVG is a fairly simple specification, so there shouldn't be too much guess work building a converter...

<p>A hash is a means of associating names with scalars. If you have a hash and a key, you have a scalar, not a reference to a hash bucket or anything like that. </p>

<pre><code>my $value = $hash{name};
</code></pre>

<p>Is just a scalar.</p>

<pre><code>my $ref = \$hash{name};

<p>Is just a reference to a scalar. No more capable of containing information that allows you to back trace to a hash key than an anonymous reference can tell you what the name might be on the symbol table, or the lexical pad (without some help). </p>

<p>I have  created a compiler in C (using lex &amp; bison) for a dynamic typed programming language that supports loops, functions declarations inside functions, recursive calls etc. I also created a virtual machine for that runs the intermediate code created by the compiler.</p>

<p>I was now  thinking instead of compiling to my own intermediate code, compile it to java byte code.                                     </p>

<p>I saw that the question about creating a JVM language has already been <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/716613/how-to-make-a-net-or-jvm-language">asked</a> but I don't find the answer very informative.</p>

<p>So here are my questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>I guess to create a language for JVM a must is to read the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html" rel="nofollow">JVM specification</a> book, what other books can you suggest (except Dragon Book of course)? I'm mostly concerned in books or tutorials on how to create a JVM language, not a compiler in general.</li>
<li>There are many Java libraries to read, write and change .class files like <a href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jclasslib/overview.html" rel="nofollow">jclasslib</a>, <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/" rel="nofollow">bcel</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/api/gnu/bytecode/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">gnu bytecode</a>, etc. Which one would you suggest? Also, are you aware of C libraries that do the same job?</li>
<li>I was thinking to have a look at maybe another language that targets the JVM like Clojure, Jython or JRuby. But all these languages are very high level and complicated (to create a compiler for them). I was looking for a simpler (I don't mind it it's unknown or unused) programming language that targets the JVM and it's compiler is open source. Any ideas?</li>
</ol>
^^
<ol>
<li><p>A reference is not an integer; it's an SV, so it's going to be something like 24 bytes, not 4.</p></li>
<li><p>Not that it matters, because you're not <em>storing</em> references, because <strong>hash keys are always strings</strong>. The keys of your <code>%group1</code> etc. hashes are actually strings that look like "HASH(0x19838e2)", which is useless.</p></li>
<li><p>Not that it matters, because Perl is smart enough to avoid wasting memory if the same strings are used as keys in multiple hashes. That's right, if you just did things the simple, obvious, sensible way, perl would use <em>less memory</em> than it does with the complicated thing you're trying to do.</p></li>
</ol>
^^
<p>You have your original angle, the last known angle (since I'm sure you're redrawing the handle as it's being dragged), and the current angle.  I'd take a look at the last known handle angle on the last redraw and compare whether the new angle, relative to that is > 180 degrees or &lt; 180 degrees.  If it's 0 - 180 degrees, it's moving in a clockwise direction, and if it's 180 - 360 degrees, it's moving in a counterclockwise direction.</p>

   void MainRoutine(Params) {
      // Want to call other routine only once
   }

   void OtherRoutine(Params) {
      // Do something that should be done only once and
      // what depends on the params
   }
};   
</code></pre>

<p>I want to call <code>OtherRoutine</code> only once in <code>MainRoutine</code> (I assume that <code>MainRoutine</code> is going to be called <code>N</code> times. I can't call <code>OtherRoutine</code> from the constructor, because it accepts <code>Params</code> which may not be available at the time when object is being constructed.</p>

<p>Basically I want to do something like</p>

<pre><code>static bool called = false;
if (!called) {
   OtherRoutine(Params);
   called = true;
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>but I hope there is a more "beautiful" way of doing this... <strong>(which could be written in one line)</em></strong></p>

<p>Maybe something using <code>boost::function</code> or some part of <code>boost</code> that I don't know about? :)</p>

<p>You can also put the call-only-once logic, which you already outlined, inside <code>OtherRoutine</code>, causing it to return early if it has already been executed before.</p>

<p>Logically, its pretty much the same.  Stylistically, it might be nicer.</p>

<p>No, you can't do this with user/page JavaScript.  I imagine it would be a security risk, if you could.</p>

<pre><code>char * myCharParameter = myStringParameter.c_str();

<p>You might need to <code>const_cast</code> the return to get it into a <code>char *</code> instead of a <code>const char *</code>. Refrain from modifying the string though; it is the internal buffer of the <code>std::string</code> object. If you actually need to modify the string, you should use <code>strncpy</code> to copy it to another buffer:</p>

<pre><code>char * myCharParameter = new char[myStringParameter.length() + 1];
strncpy(myCharParameter, myStringParameter.c_str(), myStringParameter.length() + 1);

// And later...
myStringParameter.assign(myCharParameter);

<p>You'll either need to run several processes (as above) or hook somehow into libvlc and instruct it to start up several players.</p>

<p>A good demo of this is the python wrapper to libvlc--I think--it shows how to sample to know where the stream is--however I've never tried it with multiple things running at the same time but I think it would work. </p>

<p>I avoid the "control" key, AKA <code>&lt;C&gt;</code> in vim parlance, on my laptop; I hate where Apple put it. I would really like to remap all of the vim commands using control to instead use "command", but this does not seem possible on a Mac, despite what I have read. I have read that I should use <code>&lt;Leader&gt;</code> to set such mappings, but I want to avoid remapping every single <code>&lt;C&gt;</code> mapping that I can find or think of in my .vimrc, just to forget some and bloat my .vimrc.</p>

<p>I want to avoid xmodmap or solutions beyond the scope of .vimrc, as I want to maintain compatibility of my config files that I sync across systems.</p>

<p>What I really want to do is specify an alternate key (probably <code>,</code>) as a modifier key equivalent to <code>&lt;C&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>But, the <a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html" rel="nofollow">api</a> , hopefully applied to JPA 2.0, shows the syntax as </p>

<p>Sorry, I asked this question and forgot about it.</p>

<p>There were actually two problems. </p>

<p>The first is that xperf was actually using an older cached version of my symbols. This was fixed by deleting it from the symbol cache.</p>

<p>The second was that when I loaded symbols in xperfview, it didn't actually put my up-to-date pdb into the symbols cache. The pdb was in a directory that I confirmed was included in the _NT_SYMBOL_PATH variable, however. Unfortunately, I don't remember the exact command used to fix this, but I believe it was an '<em>xperf file.etl -symbols</em>' variant. This command correctly parsed the etl and loaded/cached all of the relevant symbols as it encountered them. After this, xperfview could correctly show my symbols.</p>

<p>Note that I had to re-run the command any time my pdb changed, because xperfview still wouldn't touch anything that wasn't already in the symbol cache. I'm still not sure why it behaves this way on my machine, other people don't seem to have this problem.</p>

<p>What was the original historical use of the vertical tab character (\v in the C language, ASCII 11)?</p>

<p>Did it ever have a key on a keyboard? How did someone generate it?</p>

^^
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm listening to the UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification in order to adjust my UI based on the device's orientation. </p>

<p>The problem is that the device orientation I'm getting from the notification seems inaccurate. If I start with the phone in portrait orientation and vertical (as if taking a picture with it) the orientation I get from the notification is correct. As the tilt of the phone approaches horizontal (as in laying flat on a table top) the orientation switches to landscape. This happens much before the phone is actually flat on the table. And this is without rotating the phone towards landscape at all. Is as if it had a preference for landscape. </p>

<p>When using other apps, like mail, I don't see this same behavior. It seems that mail only switches orientation once it's really sure you've gone to the new orientation.</p>

<p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I'd most probably use the following:</p>

<pre><code>f xs = foldr g (k (last xs)) (init xs)
</code></pre>

<p>It basically means that the end of the list is replaced by <code>k x</code> when folding. Thanks to lazy evaluation present everywhere, it works even for infinite lists.</p>

<p>There are two other solutions - adding empty case and using Maybe.</p>

<p>A) adding empty case:</p>

<p>It would be best if <code>f []</code> was well-defined. Then, you could write the definition as</p>

<pre><code>f [] = c
f (x:xs) = g x (f xs)
</code></pre>

<p>which is <code>f = foldr g c</code>. For example, if you change</p>

<pre><code>data Tableau = N Expr | S Expr Tableau | B Expr Tableau Tableau
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>data Tableau = N | S Expr Tableau | B Expr Tableau Tableau
</code></pre>

<p>then you can represent single-element tableaux as <code>S expr N</code>, and the function is defined as one-liner</p>

<pre><code>f = foldr S N
</code></pre>

<p>It's the best solution as long the empty case makes sense.</p>

<p>B) use Maybe:</p>

<p>On the other hand, if <code>f []</code> cannot be sensibly defined, it's worse. 
Partial functions are often considered ugly. To make it total, you can use <code>Maybe</code>. Define</p>

<pre><code> f [] = Nothing
 f [x] = Just (k x)
 f (x:xs) = Just (g x w)
            where Just w = f xs
</code></pre>

<p>It is a total function - that's better.</p>

<p>But now you can rewrite the function into:</p>

<pre><code> f [] = Nothing
 f (x:xs) = case f xs of
              Nothing -&gt; Just (k x)
              Just w -&gt; Just (g x w)
</code></pre>

<p>which is a right fold:</p>

<pre><code> addElement :: Expr -&gt; Maybe Tableaux -&gt; Maybe Tableaux
 addElement x Nothing = Just (N x)
 addElement x (Just w) = Just (S x w)

 f = foldr addElement Nothing
</code></pre>

<p>In general, folding is idiomatic and should be used when you fit the recursion pattern. Otherwise use explicit recursion or try to reuse existing combinators. If there's a new pattern, make a combinator, but only if you'll use the pattern a lot - otherwise it's overkill. In this case, the pattern is fold for nonempty lists defined by: <code>data List a = End a | Cons a (List a)</code>.</p>
^^
<p>Obviously, you need to install PL/Ruby. After that, you can write:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION ruby_max(int4, int4) RETURNS int4 AS '
    if args[0].to_i &gt; args[1].to_i
        return args[0]
    else
        return args[1]
    end
' LANGUAGE 'plruby';

<p>Hi guys. I need some help in explaining this behavior in SQL Server 2008. I have a simple c++ program that is running a query in a loop. Here is the pseudocode of the program.</p>

<pre><code>myTempid = 0;

while (1) {
  execQuery(select a.id 
             from a,b,c,d 
            where a.id = b.id 
              and b.id = c.id 
              and c.id = d.id 
              and id.id = myTempID)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here are some facts</p>

<ol>
<li>a,b,c are empty tables</li>
<li>d has about 5500 rows</li>
</ol>

<p>The query starts out taking '0msec' (i can see this from the profiler); but then after X number of iterations; it jumps to about 60msec and stays there. The X is variant; sometimes its 100.. sometimes 200. The weird thing is that once it makes the jump from 0 to 60msec; it just stays there no matter the myID.</p>

<p>To me it sounds like SQL Server is somehow 'de-caching' the query plan?? Does this make sense to anyone</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You were definitely on the right track already. You should put your static 'called' variable inside your struct... ahem: you should make it a class instead, make it private, and make sure the state of the static variable is queried inside of OtherRoutine. <strong>You should not make it more complicated than it needs to be</strong>. Using boost, or anything else for so simple a mechanism is just overkill. </p>
^^
<p>You could achieve this with boost::function and bind. Assuming you want OtherRoutine only to be called once per object,</p>

<pre><code>struct A {
    A() {
        Routine = boost::bind(&amp;A::OtherRoutine, this); 
    }

    boost::function&lt;void()&gt; Routine;

private:
    void MainRoutine() {
        // Do stuff that should occur on every call
    }

    void OtherRoutine() {
        Routine = boost::bind(&amp;A::MainRoutine, this);
        // Do stuff that should only occur once
        MainRoutine();
    }
};

A foo;
foo.Routine(); // OtherRoutine is called
foo.Routine(); // Now all subsequent calls will go to MainRoutine
foo.Routine();
</code></pre>

<p>I would suggest doing what the other people have said, though. While this may look 'cleaner,' it's overly complicated when compared to the alternatives.</p>

<p>Vertical tab was used to speed up printer vertical movement.  Some printers used special tab belts with various tab spots.  This helped align content on forms.  VT to header space, fill in header, VT to body area, fill in lines, VT to form footer.  Generally it was coded in the program as a character constant. From the keyboard, it would be <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd>. </p>

<p>I don't believe anyone would have a reason to use it any more.  Most forms are generated in a printer control language like postscript.</p>

<p>It appears you can't without having to turn Option Strict off.
I'll research some more though.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>After going through some documentation on the <code>ExpandoObject</code>, it appears it is used in C# for COM and Office Interop. Traditionally, in VB.NET, the <code>Object</code> was used for such purposes and that would require you turn off Option Strict.</p>

<p>To answer your question this means that you can use dynamic types in VB.NET by using the <code>Object</code> type instead of the <code>ExpandoObject</code> [if such a type exists in VB.NET], set <code>Option Infer On</code> and <strong>Option Infer On or Off</strong>.<br/>
You could also consider using partial classes to localise your non Option Strict code to particular files.

<p>No.  If the Oracle stored procedure is in PL/SQL you must convert your ArrayList (or any List implementation) into an array.</p>

<p>If your stored procedure is written in Java, you could serialize your ArrayList, send the byte stream to Oracle as a long string, and reconstitute it on the Oracle side.  I did this about 10 years ago for a client and it worked very well.  There are limits on how long a string you can pass across the Java-Oracle interface so if your data structure is large you will have to divide it into chunks that will fit into a single parameter, and have the Java on the Oracle side accept multiple long string parameters.</p>

<p>Been banging my head into the wall for a while on this. I think it's time to ask the experts...</p>
^^
<p>I have a Sql Server 2005 table with following data:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NRP7d.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>idHearing is the primary key (identity), idCase is a foreign key that may duplicate.  StartDate and StartTime specify the date and time of the event - both fields are of DateTime type (for whatever reason these are separate fields).  All StartDate data has a time of 12:00:00.  All StartTime data has a date of 1/1/1900.  IsScheduled and IsOnCalendar are bit fields.</p>

<p>My challenge is to select the latest (in terms of Date/Time) hearing for each idCase.  If the StartDate/StartTime are identical (as is in the rows 1 and 2), preference should be given to a row which has IsScheduled and/or IsCalendar on.  If those are columns are same as well, then it does not matter which row gets returned.</p>

<p>To make this more complicated, I must do it all in single SELECT statement (because it must be in a view) and I have to return all the columns that you see below.</p>

<p>I've tried several ways, but my SQL-FU isn't strong.  Any ideas?</p>
^^
<p>the main difference between defaultTextFormat &amp; setTextFormat is when you actually apply the method. </p>

<p>Use defaultTextFormat when you format your TextField before defining your TextField text content, use setTextFormat when your Textfield text content has already been set. </p>

<p>In your code example, you don't mention when the text property is set. </p>

<p>Practically, if it works with one method, it should work with the other. It all depends on how you implement them</p>

<p>The notifications are just one way to get at it, you can also read out the accelerometer yourself and implement it in exactly the way you see fit (with a delay and a certain time of non-rotation for example).</p>

<p>Don't know if it's a power drain to get those readouts, but if so, use the notification to know when things are moving, and then fire up the accelometer-reading.</p>

<p>I have the python code... but how do i do it in c++?
I don't have much experience with c++. What i want is to make an exe that will be put as autorun in an cd. It has to open the application.ini file in my cd with xulrunner.exe in my cd. As the path will vary in each computer i hav to do something like this. </p>

<pre><code>import subprocess

<p>Make sure that your ListCollectionView itself isn't being created on a background thread.  I had this same problem and found that advice on <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/wpf/thread/410a0b39-dfdb-4115-8a68-4ccabc17bcb6" rel="nofollow">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/wpf/thread/410a0b39-dfdb-4115-8a68-4ccabc17bcb6</a>.

<p>There's no standard function to do this, so you'll need to compile different implementations for each platform you target.</p>

<p>On Windows, for example, you should use the temp directory, which can be obtained by a call to GetTempPath().</p>
^^
<p>chmod the dir 755 or 775, you need execute access to the directory to be able to access it.</p>

<p>The correct function is diff if you're trying to calculate the difference of C between today and yesterday.</p>

<p>I'm not completely sure I understand what you're asking, but you may want the 'system' function. This will invoke the platform's command processor to execute the command given.</p>

<p>If all of your files (xulrunner.exe and application.ini) are in the same directory as the auto-run executable, you should be able to just rely on the working directory being correct and not need to give a full path.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>system("xulrunner.exe application.ini");

<p>It depends on the platform you're implementing it for, but on Windows (assuming from the C:\ that's where you are), you'll need to dip into the Windows API and use CreateProcess. On Linux, it would be system or popen (not terribly familiar there).</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425%28VS.85%29.aspx</a></p>

<p>If the EXE you're running is known to be in the current working directory (wherever your program is started from), you can simply use the filename ("xulrunner.exe") as the name. You may be safer with ".\xulrunner.exe", but that's more preference. You can also specify a subdirectory, or even SetCurrentDirectory to move to another dir.</p>

<pre><code>BOOL startedProgram = CreateProcess("xulrunner.exe", "application.ini", [fill in other options as you need]);

<p>Unions are dangerous and risky to use without strict discipline. And the fact you put it in a struct is really dangerous because by default all struct members are public: that exposes the possibility of client code making changes to your union, without informing your program what type of data it stuffed in there. If you use a union you should put it in a class where at least you can hide it by making it private.</p>

<p>We had a dev years ago who drank the koolaid of unions, and put it in all his data structures. As a result, the features he wrote with it, are now one of the most despised parts of our entire application, since they are unmodifiable, unfixable and incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Also Unions throw away all the type safety that modern c/c++ compilers give you. Surely if you lie to the compiler it will get back at you someday. Well actually it will get back at your customer when your app crashes.</p>

<p>Hi geeks~ :)</p>

<p>In my scenario, I want to execute a method in a separate AppDomain. <strong>How many different ways</strong> could I take to achieve this?</p>

<p>Especially, I have the following question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I load an assembly into AppDomain A and execute its method in AppDomain B? </li>
<li>It seems I achieve this with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain.docallback.aspx" rel="nofollow">AppDomain.DoCallBack Method</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.crossappdomaindelegate.aspx" rel="nofollow">CrossAppDomainDelegate</a>. I just cannot figure out how could it make sense to have the assembly and the method in different AppDomains. Is the same assmebly loaded again into the other AppDomain in order to execute the method?</li>
</ul>

<p>It appears you installed WWW::Mechanize into a directory that isn't searched by default.  Most likely, you have a PERL5LIB or other environment variable that adds that directory to Perl's search path, and for some reason that's not set in the environment TextMate provides.</p>

<p>Try running <code>perl -V</code> from the shell and from TextMate and see what the difference in search paths is.  You can also add</p>

<pre><code>print "$INC{'WWW/Mechanize.pm'}\n";
</code></pre>

<p>to your test script to find out where it's installed.</p>

<p><code>os.system()</code> is <code>system()</code>, in Win32 <code>getcwd()</code> is <code>GetCurrentDirectory()</code></p>

<p>Probably should stick to char buffers for strings.  So, something like (untested, untried)</p>

<pre><code> #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 int main(int ac, char **av) {
    char path[MAX_PATH+1];
    GetCurrentDirectory(MAX_PATH, path);
    char final[MAX_PATH * 2 + 100];
    sprintf(final, "%s /xulrunner.exe %s/application.ini", path, path);
    printf("%s", final);
    system(final);
    // not sure what the notepad call is for, probably another system call
    return 0;

<p>I would recommend Sencha Touch or Sproutcore.  </p>

<p>Sencha Touch is very similar to EXTJS, which a lot of front end developers really like.  Check out</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/</a></p>

<p>It is probably more mature than SC, and you will have a larger developer base on which to draw.  You are gonna wanna try out the demos on that link, on a phone or ipad if you have one.</p>

<p>However, I personally like the strong MVC pattern that Sproutcore enforces.  The mobile framework exists, but I don't know of any major clients adopting it, yet.  The founder of SC, Charles Jolley, recently left Apple to push his framework; its gonna be big.</p>

<p>I've been using the jQuery UI button all over my page, however I haven't found a way around what seems to be a simple problem. I want some of my buttons to be smaller than the other, this should be as simple as setting the CSS of the button text to something like, <code>font: .8em;</code> However jQuery UI takes your DOM element and wraps it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button class="ui-button ui-button-text-only ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all"&gt;
   &lt;span class="ui-button-text"&gt;Button Label&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;

<p>So if I have a <code>&lt;button class="small-button"&gt;Small button!&lt;/button&gt;</code> jQuery will place the text in a child span. Any font size given to the <code>small-button</code> class will be ignored.</p>

<p>There's got to be a way around this without hacking at how jQuery makes its buttons. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Does PHP have a virtual machine like Java?</p>

<pre><code>char patches2[][64]
</code></pre>

<p>This is an array of arrays.  The first dimension is determined automatically from the number of elements in the initializer.  The second dimension is specified as being 64 <code>char</code>s.</p>

<p>Some of the string literals with which you initialize <code>patches2</code> are longer than 64 characters in length.  You need to increase the size to some value large enough to hold the largest C string in the initializer.</p>

<p>Boost's Filesystem library provides platform-independent directory functions. It will increase your program size a bit, but using Boost is often better (and often easier) than rolling your own.</p>

  <p>What sort of frameworks should I be looking at?</p>

<p>Try a modern framework like <a href="http://kohanaframework.org/" rel="nofollow">Kohana</a> or maybe something more engineered-OO like <a href="http://framework.zend.com/" rel="nofollow">Zend Framework</a>.  </p>

<p>You also might want to consider a simple <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3023818/any-procedural-php-framework-non-oo">procedural framework</a> instead of an OO framework.  PHP does very, very well working at low levels.</p>

<p>Avoid Cake.  It tries to be Rails-like, but not only do Rails idioms translate very poorly into PHP, Cake is stuck in the design era of PHP4. </p>
^^
<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Independently from the platform PHP is running on, the scripts are compiled into the same bytecode and run by the Zend Engine.</p>

<p>The difference from Java is that this compiled code is usually not stored into separate files and the scripts are re-compiled on each execution (however, see opcode caches).</p>

<p>I'm using feincms in a django project and I want to use manage.py dumpdata but I get nothing:</p>

<p>Well, the declaration for a single string looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>const char* myString = "MyString";
</code></pre>

<p>What you probably want is an array of <code>const char*</code>s. You can change <code>char patches2[][64]</code> to <code>const char* patches2[]</code> (an array of pointers to <code>const char</code>).</p>

<p>The number of <code>const char*</code>s in <code>patches2</code> can be calculated using <code>sizeof()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>const char* patches2[] = {"CreateMutexW", /* The rest... */ };
int numPatches = sizeof(patches2) / sizeof(const char*);
</code></pre>

<p>So if you add/remove some strings, you don't have to update the dimensions.</p>

<p>Are you runnin IIS on the same machine? By default, they will try to bind to the same port 80), and if IIS is running on bootup, then Apache will not be able to start. Try disabling IIS on startup, or else change the port that one or the other uses.</p>

<p>Active Directory defaults to returning a max of 1000 results.  What is sort of annoying is that rather than return 1000, with an associated error code, it seems to send the error code without the data.</p>

<p>eDirectory starts with no default, and is completely conifgurable to whatever you like.</p>

<p>Other directories handle it differently.  (Edit and add in, if you know).</p>

           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY t.idcase ORDER BY t.startdate DESC,

<p>I have a program with a function copied below it plays a sound upon clicking a button. If you click the button 10 times 10 different media players play the same sound that is the way i want it but how can i assign a button to stop all 10 media players at a time like a "STOP ALL BUTTON"</p>

<pre><code>public void onClick(View v){
 int resId = 0;
 int stopped = 0;
 switch (v.getId()){
 case R.id.Wail:
  resId = R.raw.fedsigwail;
  break;
 case R.id.Yelp:
  resId = R.raw.fedsigyelp;
  break;
 case R.id.HiLow:
  resId = R.raw.hilow;     
  break;
 case R.id.FederalQ:
  resId = R.raw.federalq;
  break;
 case R.id.Horn:
  resId = R.raw.fedsignhorn;
  break;
 case R.id.STOPALL:
  mp.stop();
  mp.release();
  stopped = 1;
  break;
 }

 if (stopped != 1){
 mp = MediaPlayer.create(this, resId);
 mp.start();
 }

<p>The code above only stops the last instance of mp.</p>

<p>If it's styling <code>ui-button-text</code> with <code>font-size</code> directly, you can override it at a higher level by applying !important. Such as:</p>

<pre><code>.small-button {
   font-size: .8em !important;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: try setting a CSS style directly on <code>.ui-button-text</code> to inherit:</p>

<pre><code>.ui-button-text {
   font-size: inherit !important;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>This should also make the !important on the <code>.small-button</code> irrelevant.</p>
^^
<p>There is no built-in event type that is fired when the enter key is pressed, you need to check that in the <code>Event</code> object that is passed to the handler.</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input name ="txtChat" id ="txtChat" onkeyup="onKeyPressed(event)"  type="text" style="width:720px;"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>function onKeyPressed(ev) {
   var e = ev || event;
   if(e.keyCode == 13) {
      //Enter was pressed
      return false; //prevents form from being submitted.
   }
}
</code></pre>
^^
<p>A very simple inline check is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input name ="txtChat" id ="txtChat" onkeydown ="alert(event.keyCode == 13);"  type="text" style="width:720px;"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which outputs <code>true</code> if enter is pressed.</p>

<p>As always when doing LDAP bind testing this way, recall that the standard requires that a bind of a username, no password, is a successful Anonymous bind, so therefore you MUST validate for this case (empty password) on login attempts.</p>

<p>In order to execute code in a separate AppDomain, the assembly containing that code has to be loaded into that AppDomain. From there you can call a method in the second AppDomain from your hosting domain using reflection or the "CreateInstance" methods on the AppDomain class.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, AppDomains are hard boundaries. In order to communicate across the AppDomain boundaries, you will need to use remoting or a true IPC-ish mechanism.</p>

<p>This is a bit dated, but I believe it still applies. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/suzcook/archive/2003/06/12/57169.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/suzcook/archive/2003/06/12/57169.aspx</a></p>

<p>Suzanne Cook had a series of posts related to this subject so it may be worth browsing her archives a bit.</p>

<p>Check out the "CreateInstance" family of methods on the AppDomain class. In the past I've used <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain.createinstanceandunwrap.aspx" rel="nofollow">CreateInstanceFromAndUnwrap()</a> quite a bit for this type of situation.</p>

<p>As far as your question about how many ways there are to do this... Um, many, but it depends a lot on the exact situation and what objects you have in hand.</p>

<p>Hey guys, I am trying to figure out how I can call a function without having it being exported.</p>

<p>Okay so I have an exe file with "add" defined in it, This exe is a win32 console application and loads a DLL. The DLL also aims to use the add function from the exe file ( without exports )</p>

<p>Here is my main win32 console application file:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#pragma auto_inline ( off )

int add ( int a, int b )
{
    printf( "Adding some ints\n" );
    return a + b;
}

int main ( )
{
    HMODULE module = NULL;

    if ( (module = LoadLibrary( L"hook.dll" )) == NULL )
    {
        printf( "Could not load library: %ld\n", GetLastError() );
        return 0;
    }

    add( 3, 5 );

    FreeLibrary( module );

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is code for hook.dll:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;detours.h&gt;

static int (*add) ( int a, int b ) = ( int (*)( int a, int b ) ) 0x401000;

int Detoured_add ( int a, int b )
{
    return add( a, b );
}

BOOL WINAPI DllMain ( HINSTANCE hDll, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved )
{
    if ( reason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH )
    {
        DetourTransactionBegin();
        DetourAttach( (PVOID*) &amp;add, Detoured_add );
        DetourTransactionCommit();

    }
    else if ( reason == DLL_PROCESS_DETACH )
    {
        DetourTransactionBegin();
        DetourDetach( (PVOID*) &amp;add, Detoured_add );
        DetourTransactionCommit();
    }

    return TRUE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I disassembled my win32 console application to find the address of the add function</p>

<pre><code>.text:00401000 ; ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ S U B R O U T I N E ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦

.text:00401000                 push    offset aAddingSomeInts ; "Adding some ints\n"
.text:00401005                 call    ds:printf
.text:0040100B                 add     esp, 4
.text:0040100E                 mov     eax, 8
.text:00401013                 retn
.text:00401013 sub_401000      endp

<p>The problem is when I call LoadLibrary, it returns 998 which I believe is error code access violation. I guess this makes sense though as that memory area is probably protected.</p>

<p>Any tips?</p>

<p>It was used during the typewriter era to move down a page to the next vertical stop, typically spaced 6 lines apart (much the same way horizontal tabs move along a line by 8 characters).</p>

<p>Make an outlet for the button and connect it.</p>

<p>in the .h, between the curly braces</p>

<pre><code> UIButton* button;
</code></pre>

<p>after the curly</p>

<pre><code> @property(retain, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIButton* button;
</code></pre>

<p>and in the .m, after the @implementation</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize button;
</code></pre>

<p>Then connect in IB by dragging a referencing outlet circle in the connections inspector to File's Owner and choosing button.</p>

<p>Now you can change the button text with </p>

<pre><code> [self.button setTitle: @"hello" forState: UIControlStateNormal]; // or any string, like from your table
</code></pre>
^^
<p>Pretty much the same as omg ponies answer. Row_number is your friend. I'm not entirely sure the bit fields are treated as you want, but you get the idea. As ever, it's always best to be explicit with the fields you are selecting, but I'm lazy.</p>

    idHearing int,
    idCase int,
    startDate datetime,
    starttime datetime,
    isscheduled bit,
    isoncalendar bit

                isscheduled desc,

<p>For the automatic checking with delay, you should use an AsyncTask, like a thread where you can modify things within the Android main UI thread, i.e. like checking the checkboxes.</p>

<p>The checkboxes can be part of a listview, but don't have to be. You can also add them into a LinearLayout with vertical orientation one by one.</p>
^^
<p>You can do like this:</p>

<p>You have to pass the button to the UITableViewController and then when you select a row, set the text for the button:</p>

<pre><code>UITableViewController *viewController = [[CustomTableViewController alloc] initWithButton:self.button];
</code></pre>

<p>then in tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath:</p>

<pre><code>[self.button setTitle:cell.textLabel.text forState:UIControlStateNormal];
</code></pre>

<p>Don't forget to save the button in your init with:</p>

<pre><code>-(id)initWithButton:(UIButton *)button {
  // do something
  _button = button
}

<p>Is there an easy to have more than 1 red "destructive button" in an iPhone app's UIActionSheet?</p>

<p>I wanted to make 1 "DELETE" button... and then have the actionSheet ask/confirm between 3-4 different "delete choices" (or just 1 cancel).</p>

<p>(Instead of having 4 different DELETE buttons... and have to maintain 4 different actionSheets... 1 for each)</p>

<p>... also... would Apple have a problem with a submission to the appStore with this idea?</p>

<p>Adding to Rob's correct answer, I want to mention that any attempt to call without using reflection is going to cause the assembly to be loaded into your calling AppDomain, which may well be what you're trying to avoid.</p>
^^
<p><code>mp.stop();</code> only stops one instance of a media player, since mp can only be one mediaplayer instance.
If mp is one of your media players, where are the other ones? You mentioned you have </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10 different media players</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so I would expect something like mp1, mp2, mp3, ..., mp10. But right now it seems you actually only using one media player instance, or at least stopping it.</p>

<p>With each call of</p>

<pre><code>mp = MediaPlayer.create(this, resId)
</code></pre>

<p>you lose the reference to the previous created media player, since you 'override' it with a newly created instance.
You need to keep a reference to all your created media players, i.e. via an ArrayList or HashMap or similar.</p>

<p>This is the XML layout:</p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>It uses a class that extends <code>AsyncTask</code> which allows you to use threading in a easy to use/understand way. The way this class is executed is kind of simple:</p>

<pre><code>new CheckerAsync(AutoChecker.this).execute(checkbox1, checkbox2);
</code></pre>

<p>You can add as many checkboxes as you want. For instance: </p>

<pre><code>new CheckerAsync(AutoChecker.this).execute(checkbox1, checkbox2, checkbox4, checkbox3);
</code></pre>

<p>Right now I am trying to use selenium ide to write code that makes sure web pages on a website work. On one particular page there is a table that has text boxes in each cell. You can add a row by clicking a button. What I want to do on this page is type data into the first two rows. I used selenium ide and recorded me typing in data. Then I tried to replay it. It worked fine until it came to the second row. The second row it could not write data to. The first row text boxes had targets of terms[] and defs[] . the second row looks the exact same but has targets of <code>//td[@id='autoDefinerTd']/textarea</code> and <code>//table[@id='termList']/tbody/tr[3]/td[3]/textarea</code> . I am completely stumped on what to do to fix this and why they are different. If someone could help me I would be so grateful.

<h2>Use Case:</h2>

<p>Would like to use IReport to Label item sold in my shop. The thing with labels is that for each product there can be multiple items that need to be labeled. So let say product CarToy is 1 record in database (field name, description, price).</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>To label CarToy item in my shop I will have to print a report containing the 3 field on a sticker paper.</p>

<p>Doing it the normal way will result to a report containing 1 sticker. </p>

<p>If there is 5 item in my shop. Then I would like to print 5 sticker in the report. </p>

<p>Basically I would like to pass a query result containing records (row of data) to IReport and tell it how many time to print/display each record/row. Assuming that I can pass the required parameter (for instance repeat X time) from my program.</p>

<p>Any idea how this can be done?</p>

<h2>Unwanted Solution</h2>

<p>Possibly this can be solve at software data layer. For instance I can pass a result set that contains each row already duplicated/repeat X times. Example: Query the CarToy (which result to 1 record). Manually create a result set containing 5 CarToy records and pass this to Jasper Report.</p>

<p>However I would like to give a solution to end user in a form of JasperReport report xml that can be customized on their side. So above is not a solution that I'm looking for.</p>

<p>Better yet if I can do everything using IReport withou any requirement to modify software. For this to be done perhaps there is some scripting ability or I can create a simple GUI in IReport that accept the (repeat X time) parameter.</p>

<p>Ryan, there is a php framework called <a href="http://www.elgg.org" rel="nofollow">Elgg</a> which is a php framework directed at social networking based applications.</p>

<p>I have my own, very fast cos function:</p>

<pre><code>float sine(float x)

    const float B = 4/pi;
    const float C = -4/(pi*pi);

    float y = B * x + C * x * abs(x);

    //  const float Q = 0.775;
    const float P = 0.225;

    y = P * (y * abs(y) - y) + y;   // Q * y + P * y * abs(y)


    return y;
}

float cosine(float x)
{
    return sine(x + (pi / 2));
}
</code></pre>

<p>But now when I profile, I see that acos() is killing the processor. I don't need instense precision. What is a fast way to calculate acos(x)

<p>Hi,
If I were to use separate Windows Server that was PCI-DSS compliant, would I still be compliant if I had a SQL Azure hosting the backend? This is assuming that I'm compliant at the application layer, and that I'm only storing permitted values (like no CVV), etc.</p>

<p>I've just been browsing and spotted the following...</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/54585/when-should-you-use-a-class-vs-a-struct-in-c">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/54585/when-should-you-use-a-class-vs-a-struct-in-c</a></p>

<p>The consensus there is that, by convention, you should only use struct for POD, no methods, etc.</p>

<p>I've always felt that some types were naturally structs rather than classes, yet could still have a few helper functions as members. The struct should still be POD by most of the usual rules - in particular it must be safe to copy using memcpy. It <em>must</em> have all member data public. But it still makes sense to me to have helper functions as members. I wouldn't even necessarily object to a private method, though I don't recall ever doing this myself. And although it breaks the normal POD rules, I wouldn't object to a struct having constructors, provided they were just initialise-a-few-fields constructors (overriding assignment or destructors would definitely be against the rules).</p>

<p>To me a struct is intuitively a collection of fields - a data structure node or whatever - whereas a class is an abstraction. The logical place to put the helper functions for your collection-of-fields may well be within the struct.</p>

<p>I even <em>think</em> I once read some advice along these lines, though I don't remember where.</p>

<p>Is this against accepted best practice?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> - POD (Plain Old Data) is misrepresented by this question. In particular, a struct can be non-POD purely because a member is non-POD - e.g. an aggregate with a member of type std::string. That aggregate must not be copied with memcpy. In case of confusion, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/146452/what-are-pod-types-in-c">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have a simple online product that I'm selling. I need a credit card order form. </p>

<p>I'm looking for a sample php based order form. A form that collects name, address, credit card, exp date, and cvv and validates that the fields (for example checks that the credit card number is in the correct format). Forget the payment gateway integration I just need the the form and validation. </p>

<p>Does anyone know of such a resource? </p>
^^
<p>Another way that verges on "cute" would be to have a static object and call your function from within its constructor.  Something like...</p>

<pre><code>   struct OneShotOtherRoutine
   {
      OneShotOtherRoutine(A a, Params params)
      {
         a.OtherRoutine(params);
      }
   };

   struct A
   {
      friend struct OneShotOtherRoutine;
      public:
         void MainRoutine(Params params)
         {
              static OneShotOtherRoutine(params);
              // Main Routine code
         }
      private:
         void OtherRoutine(Params params)
         {
           // Other routine code
         }
  };
</code></pre>

<p>You'd have to split things up so that each implementation could see the other struct's declaration, but this could do what you want, assuming it's acceptable that <code>OtherRoutine</code> gets called when statics are initialized.</p>
^^
<p>It happens because your pointers point to no memory.</p>

<pre><code>char* z; // pointer points nowhere
/* snip */
fgets(z, 2, stdin); // writing to pointer that points nowhere: boom!
</code></pre>

<p>This tries to put into <code>z</code> the two next characters from <code>stdin</code>. However, <code>z</code> points to nowhere useful. You need it to point to existing memory: declaring a pointer alone isn't enough to get memory next to it.</p>

<p>You probably want a buffer of 2 characters for it:</p>

<pre><code>char z[2];
</code></pre>

<p>With this code, <code>z</code> will be a pointer to enough memory for 2 characters. (In C, an array can be passed wherever a pointer is expected.)</p>

<p>I didn't look too far into your code, but you'll have the same problem for <code>y</code>.</p>
^^
<p>For anybody else that has this issue, a good application I just found is the sample app included with the source. For anybody answering, I didn't think about checking the source for samples when I posted this. The name of the sample is called FunnyBrowser.cs.</p>
^^
<p>You haven't allocated any memory for <code>z</code> or <code>y</code> <strong>and</strong> they're left uninitialized so <code>fgets</code> is writing to random addresses.</p>
^^
<p>Got spare memory? A lookup table (with interpolation, if required) is gonna be fastest.</p>
^^
<p>Using nested <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s you can create a dashed border with alternating colors:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ff0"&gt;
  &lt;span style="border-bottom: 3px dashed #f00"&gt;
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It would be a bit harder to do with dots, though.</p>
^^
<p>If you're using the GPS_Provider, make sure that you have the following permission in your app manifest:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But usually GPS only works with a free sky (not indoors very well). Therefore while Google Maps might show the last known location, maybe your app doesn't. So you might want to initially call <code>getLastKnowLocation</code> initially to set the initial marker. 
Even though GPS cannot get a fix, you could still show the last known location known to the device, i.e. when you were outdoors last time.</p>

<p>Alternatively or additionally to GPS_Provider, you could also use the</p>

<pre><code>LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER
</code></pre>

<p>instead,which is based on Wifi and/or GMS, is less accurate than GPS but works indoors.</p>

<p>For this, you need the permission</p>

<pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>in your manifest.</p>

<p>I've got a project in a git repository that uses some custom (and so far unversioned) setup scripts for the build environment etc. I'd like to put these under version control (hopefully git) but keep them versioned separate from the project itself, while still living in the base directory of the project - I've considered options like local branches but these seem to have the problem that switch back to <code>master</code> (or any other "real" branch) will throw away the working copies of the setup scripts.</p>

<p>I'm on Windows using msysgit so I've got a few tools to play with; does anyone have a recommendation or solution?</p>
^^
<p>It is, in fact, possible. Here's how I did it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="checkout-flow-support.merchant-checkout-flow-support.shipping-methods.flat-rate-shipping-1.name" value="Delivery"/&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="checkout-flow-support.merchant-checkout-flow-support.shipping-methods.flat-rate-shipping-1.price" value="123.45"/&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="checkout-flow-support.merchant-checkout-flow-support.shipping-methods.flat-rate-shipping-1.price.currency" value="USD"/&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="checkout-flow-support.merchant-checkout-flow-support.shipping-methods.flat-rate-shipping-1.shipping-restrictions.allow-us-po-box" value="false"/&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="checkout-flow-support.merchant-checkout-flow-support.shipping-methods.flat-rate-shipping-1.shipping-restrictions.allowed-areas.us-country-area-1.country-area" value="CONTINENTAL_48"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Tricky for sure, but it works.</p>

  <p>HTML offers authors several mechanisms for specifying lists of information. All lists must 
  contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain: unordered information, ordered 
  information and definitions. (from <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/lists.html#edef-UL" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/lists.html#edef-UL</a>)</p>

<p>I think lists are the most important elements in HTML: semantically, there are so many objects that are pure lists. It is also a good practice to use <code>ul</code> or <code>dl</code> to group input fields and labels in <code>form</code> too. </p>

<p>Reading Remou's comment, I inserted an extra column at the beginning in the excel worksheet and numbered it in series from 1.</p>

<p>Importing into access after this didn't cause any reordering of rows.</p>

<p>After an animation involving the opacity, you will want to clear the opacity value (back to a default of no value) to fix this mangled antialiasing in IE. Try this jQuery on the section in question after the animation is complete (e.g. in a callback):</p>

<pre><code>$('.item').css('filter','');

<p>If anyone read my last question, this is somewhat of a continuation of it.</p>

<p>AFAIK, when using jQuery UI's Autocomplete ability to grab data from an XML file as its data source, you can only do it from one file in the Ajax call.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.finalfantasyunion.com/includes/xml/games.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.finalfantasyunion.com/includes/xml/games.xml</a></p>

<p>I'm planning to have a series of XML files like that with different data but the same items -> item tag format.</p>

<p>I could have a MySQL database which I query data from (where the file is really an PHP file but reports itself as a XML file once I've gotten the data) dynamically create an XML file, but if possible I'd rather not have this require a database connection if at all possible --- that way other staff members could edit the file easily as new games are announced/etc.</p>

<p>EDIT: The reason I don't want everything in one file is because I plan to use autocomplete elsewhere in the backend, and I'll only need specific data for some sections.</p>

<p>It depends on whether MyMethod actually changes the string that's passed in.</p>

<p>If the only thing you know about it is the signature, then you have to assume it could change the string, and copy it into a temporary buffer per @jdmichal's answer.</p>

<p>It's also possible that the developer of this API didn't know or care about <code>const</code> correctness.  So the function takes in a non-<code>const</code> buffer even though it doesn't change it.</p>

<p>If that's the case you can get by with:</p>

<pre><code>MyMethod(const_cast&lt;char*&gt;(myStringParameter.c_str());
</code></pre>

<p>In my career I have come across more than a few API's taking in non-<code>const</code> strings that should have been <code>const</code>.</p>

<p>Let's say I have a piece of code that runs fine on an OS. Now, if I install that OS on a virtual machine (server virtualization), and run that code on that, is it possible that the code behaves differently?  </p>

<p>If so, what are the prerequisites for that? For example, does it have to be compiled machine code (in other words, are interpreted languages safe?)? Does it have to be certain OS instructions? Specific virtualization technology (Xen, KVM, VMware..)?    </p>

<p>I know that <code>.index()</code> will return where a substring is located in python. 
However, what I want is to find where a substring is located for the nth time, which would work like this:</p>

&gt;&gt; s.index('a')
0
&gt;&gt; s.nindex('a', 1)
6
&gt;&gt;s.nindex('a', 2)

  <p>According to the Android JavaDocs, it
  is only possible to have one
  MapActivity per class</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not one map view per class, it's per process.</p>

<p>It's known that you might experience some issues when using multiple mapviews in one process. Usually this is the case (your app running in one process) if you don't configure anything specific.
You could though use the android:process attribute in your manifest to assign to your acitivites:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity android:name=".activity.directory.MapView1" android:process=":MapView1"&gt;

&lt;activity android:name=".activity.directory.MapView2" android:process=":MapView2"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This way you have the activities running in separate processes, which works well if you don't use any shared static variables across activities.</p>

<p>I have been using Wincent Colaiuta's <a href="https://wincent.com/products/command-t/" rel="nofollow">Command-T vim plugin</a> for a couple months now. Wincent wrote the parts of it that need to be fast in C, and I must say that it is! And, I think its file pattern matching logic is even better than Textmate's Command-T. Check out the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.wincent.com/command-t/screencasts/command-t-demo.mov?width=640&amp;height=480" rel="nofollow">screencast</a>.</p>

  Command-T in TextMate.</p>
  
  <p>Files are selected by typing
  characters that appear in their paths,

<p><a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Easier_buffer_switching" rel="nofollow">Easier buffer switching</a> contains many useful tips. I have adapted the following to my .vimrc, which does buffer-name auto-completion, maps the most useful buffer-switching commands to my &lt;Leader&gt; and left-side home row keys, and shows the current buffer number in the status line:</p>

<pre><code>"" Tab triggers buffer-name auto-completion
set wildchar=&lt;Tab&gt; wildmenu wildmode=full

let mapleader = ","

map &lt;Leader&gt;t :CommandT&lt;Return&gt;
map &lt;Leader&gt;a :bprev&lt;Return&gt;
map &lt;Leader&gt;s :bnext&lt;Return&gt;
map &lt;Leader&gt;d :bd&lt;Return&gt;
map &lt;Leader&gt;f :b 

"" Show the buffer number in the status line.
set laststatus=2 statusline=%02n:%&lt;%f\ %h%m%r%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P

<p>It really depends what you mean by "not intense precision"...</p>

<p>You could do it extremely roughly:</p>

<pre><code>float arccos(float x)
{
    return pi * (-x) / 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a straight-line function</p>

<p>This is very similar to arcsin:</p>

<pre><code>float arcsin(float x)
{
    return -pi * x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, arc-cosine is just arc-sin flipped and shifted up by <code>π/2</code>.</p>

<p>So you could also write your arccos function as:</p>

<pre><code>float arccos(float x) {
    return(pi * 1.5 - arcsin(x));
}
</code></pre>

<p>As far as the language is concerned, it doesn't matter, except for default <code>private</code> vs. <code>public</code> access.  The choice is subjective.</p>

<p>I'd personally say use <code>struct</code> for PODs, but remember that "POD" doesn't mean "no member functions".  It means no <em>virtual</em> functions, constructors, destructor, or <code>operator=</code>.</p>

<p>Edit: I also use <code>struct</code>s for simple <code>public</code>-access aggregates of data, even if their members aren't PODs.</p>

<p>Reconstructing the signature created by Facebook is rather simple. You just need to append all <code>key=value</code> pairs, then append your private key, and finally compute the MD5 hash of the resulting string.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, all the standard STL functors are defined as structs, and their <em>sole purpose</em> is to have member functions; STL functors aren't supposed to have state.</p>

<p>EDIT: Personally, I use <code>struct</code> whenever a class has all public members. It matters little, so long as one is consistent.</p>

<p>Without the details of the error you are seeing it is hard to be sure but I'm quite sure that your map is failing because all the parameters within the BizTalk XSLT engine are passed as strings<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>When I try to run something like the function you provided as inline C# I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Object of type 'System.String' cannot be converted to type 'System.DateTime'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Replace your inline C# with something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>public string ConvertDateTime(string param1)
{
    DateTime inputDate = DateTime.Parse(param1);
    return inputDate.ToString("yyyyMMdd");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the parameter type is now string, and you can then convert that to a DateTime and perform your string format.</p>

<p>As other answers have suggested, it may be better to put this helper method into an external class - that way you can get your code under test to deal with edge cases, and you also get some reuse.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> The fact that all parameters in the BizTalk XSLT are strings can be the source of a lot of gotchas - one other common one is with math calculations. If you return numeric values from your scripting functoids BizTalk will helpfully convert them to strings to map them to the outbound schema but will not so helpfully perform some very random rounding on the resulting values. Converting the return values to strings yourself within the C# will remove this risk and give you the expected results.</p>

<p>VVS's answer is correct, with the exception of parsing a path given by a file input in internet explorer (tested with IE8 - I do not know about other versions).

<p>The "CVV" (probably the CVV2, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_security_code" rel="nofollow">CSC</a> in general) appears to be the output of a hash function that's stored by the bank, and I suspect that you'd actually have to attempt a transaction to validate it.

<p>Say I have a table animals that has a column parent_id
Say also that I have a type_id on the table to indicate species</p>

<p>So in my Animal class, Animall.all would return all animals.</p>

<p>Say that now I add two new animal types, dog and cat in the animal_types table.  So now some animals have type_id of 1 and some 2.</p>

<p>I could write a named_scope on Animal to return all cats or all dogs.</p>

<p>But what if I wanted to go the route of creating cat and dog classes that reference the animals table, so in dog class, dog.all should issue a query, select * from animals where type_id = 1</p>

<p>Then say I create a class called person, and added a has_many :dogs relationship</p>

<p>Make Array is "Static"</p>
^^
<p>Use a broadcast/broadcast receiver</p>
^^
<p>I would suggest that your question needs to be clarified.  Currently, everyone is guessing what about what you are actually asking.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are the arrays intended to represent sets, or lists, or something in between?  In other words, does element order matter, and can there be duplicates?</li>
<li>What does "equal" mean?  Does <code>new Cat()</code> "equal" <code>new Cat()</code>?  Your example suggests that it does!!</li>
<li>What do you mean by the "difference"?  Do you mean set difference?</li>
<li>What do you want to happen if the two arrays have the same length?</li>
<li>Is this a once-off comparison or does it occur repeatedly for the same arrays?</li>
<li>How many elements are there in the arrays (on average)?</li>
<li>Why are you using arrays at all?</li>
</ul>

<p>Making the assumption that these arrays are intended to be true sets, then you probably should be using <code>HashSet</code> instead of arrays, and using collection operations like <code>addAll</code> and <code>retainAll</code> to calculate the set difference.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the arrays are meant to represent lists, it is not at all clear what "difference" means.</p>

<p>If it is critical that the code runs fast, then you most certainly need to rethink your data structures.  If you always start with arrays, you are not going to be able to calculate the "differences" fast ... at least in the general case.</p>

<p>Finally, if you are going to use anything that depends on the <code>equals(Object)</code> method (and that includes any of the Java collection types, you really need to have a clear understanding of what "equals" is supposed to mean in your application.  Are all <code>Cat</code> instances equal?  Are they all different?  Are some <code>Cat</code> instances equal and others not?  If you don't figure this out, and implement the <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> methods accordingly you will get confusing results.</p>

<p>If you're referring to the automatically generated .config file, then no, the service need not be rebuilt. My guess is that in your last iteration you forgot an end tag or something, which caused the service to fail to load it's configuration.</p>

<p>Your variable needs a name:</p>

<pre><code>static std::vector&lt;int&gt; my_static_vector(3);
</code></pre>
^^
<p>You forgot to give the vector a name, so without any variable pointing to it it's destroyed immediately after it's created</p>
^^
<p>Because <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;(3)</code> creates an unnamed temporary, which lives only to the end of it's contained expression. The debugger can't show destruction in the same line as construction though, so it shows it on the next line.</p>

<p>The two events that you should use are <code>FormClosing</code> and <code>FormClosed</code>.</p>

<p>In the .Net Framework verion 2.0 these events replaced the obsolete <code>Closing</code> and <code>Closed</code> events.</p>

<p>The reason for the new events was that the old ones were not raised when the <code>Application.Exit</code> method was called.</p>

<p>An example of the usage of the <code>FormClosing</code> event is below:</p>

<pre><code>public Form1()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    this.FormClosing += Form1_FormClosing;
}

private void Form1_FormClosing(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e)
{
    DialogResult result = MessageBox.Show("Really close this form?", string.Empty, MessageBoxButtons.YesNo);

    if (result == DialogResult.No)
    {
        e.Cancel = true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That code simply asks the user if they want to close the form, and if No is selected, it then cancels the event. You can put any logic you require in the event handler.</p>

<hr>

<p>The MSDN article on <code>Form.Closing</code> is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.closing.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> and includes references about why the event was made obsolete.

<p>You said, "To me a struct is intuitively a collection of fields - a data structure node or whatever".  What you are describing is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Data_Structures" rel="nofollow">Plain Old Data</a>.  The C++ standard does have an opinion of what POD means with respect to C++ language features.  I suggest that, where possible, you adopt the meaning of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x#Modification_to_the_definition_of_plain_old_data" rel="nofollow">POD used in C++0x</a>.</p>

<p>I need to find a reference for this, but I thought that, as far as type definitions are concerned, the keywords "struct" and "class" are to be synonyms in C++0x.  The only difference being that class defaults to private members, while a struct defaults to public.  This means that you'll never see complier error messages like "Type X first seen using struct, now seen using class." once we're all using C++0x.</p>

<p>I think that it is wrong to have strict rules on when to use class and when to use struct.  If consistency is important to you, the go ahead and make a coding standard that has what ever sort of rules you like.  Just make sure everyone knows that your coding standard relates to how you want you code to look - it doesn't relate to the underlying language features at all.</p>

<p>Maybe to give an example where I break all your rules, you say "To me a struct is intuitively a collection of fields - a data structure node or whatever - whereas a class is an abstraction."  When I want to write a class that implements some abstraction, I define the interface as a struct with pure virtual methods (egad!) - this is exposed in a header, as too is a factory method to construct my concrete class.  The concrete class is not exposed i a public header at all.  Since the concrete class is a secret, it can be implemented however I like and it makes no difference to external code.</p>

<p>I'd suggest that if you think that the keywords struct and class have any relation to the concept of POD, then you're not understanding C++ yet.</p>

<p>With PCI DSS it is important to remember that it is not just about storing, it's "store, process, or transmit." If any of this happens in or through the cloud then the cloud becomes part of your cardholder data environment, thus in scope for PCI compliance.

<p>How does the XAML engine search for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.binding.elementname.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Binding.ElementName</code></a> vs <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.relativesource.ancestortype.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>RelativeSource.AncestorType</code></a>.</p>

<p>It would take a huge different when I am searching for a parent Window or Page (that x:Name was set in it), if the ElementName searches up (meaning starting from near current element up the tree levels children, then it's better to use the AncestorType since it won't search the siblings, just the ancestors.
But if it (the ElementName) starts from to top of the visual tree and goes deeper and deeper, then of course I should get it by the ElementName property.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: my question is whether the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.binding.elementname.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Binding.ElementName</code></a> is search for the name from the top of the tree, or from the point of the binding upwards.</p>

<p>Yes. Like any machine, the virtual machine is just another computer (implemented in software instead of hardware).</p>

<p>For one, lots of commercial apps will blow up when you run them on a VM due to:</p>

<ol>
<li>copy protection detecting the VM</li>
<li>copy protection rigging your hardware, using undocumented features of BIOS/Kernel/hardware</li>
</ol>

<p>Secondly, a VM is just another computer consisting of hardware implemented in assembly instead of circuits/dye/microcode/magic. This means the VM must provide the emulated hardware either through pass-through or emulation. The fact that hardware is very diverse can cause all kinds of different behavior. Also note the possible lack of drivers for or acceleration of the emulated hardware.</p>

<p>But of course a typical business application for example isn't nearly as likely to rely on any hardware details as all it does is call some GUI API.</p>

<p>Interpreted languages are only safe from this to the extent that they are "interpreted", if the interpreted language calls out to some native code, all this is possible again.</p>

<p>For an example of something detecting that it's running under a VM, check <a href="http://invisiblethings.org/papers/redpill.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, it's just one of the literally thousands of ways to detect the VM.</p>

<p>The results from SQL Profiler can by tricky to interpret.</p>

<p>The time shown for a command includes the time for the record set to be delivered to the client.  To see this, create a SELECT statement that returns at least a million rows.  Run these tests is SQL Management Studio and run SQL Profiler to trace the results.</p>

<p>First run, send the SQL results to a temporary table (should take a second or so).  Second run, send the the SQL results to the Results window (should take a few seconds).  Note the run time shown in SSMS.  Then note the time reported by SQL Profiler.</p>

<p>You should see that the the time SSMS takes to read the record set, format the results, and display them to Result window increases the duration that is reported for the query.</p>

<p>After all that, I'm saying that when you are running the query from your application, at that level of precision (60 ms), you cannot tell where the slow down is coming from: database, network, or application, just from the reported duration.</p>

<p>You should create a test script and run the query in SSMS and see if the query time degrades when your application is not part of the loop.</p>

<p>SQL Profiler 2008 records duration in microseconds, but only displays it in milliseconds; so rounding is an issue.  Save the trace as a Trace Table and look at results in the Duration column to see the microseconds.  If the problem is within SQL Server, you may see the duration increasing over time.</p>

<p>You can also have the Profiler return the execution plan.  You can look at the execution plan before and after the duration increases and see if the execution plan is changing.</p>
^^
<p>The lines:</p>

<pre><code>sys.argv.append("py2exe")
sys.argv.append("-q")
</code></pre>

<p>seem "unusual" and likely to be causing that "invalid command" message. I'd be curious to know the rationale for having them.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>A common convention is to name the script <code>setup.py</code> (although in this case it's named <code>p2e_simple_con.py</code> it seems). The <code>setup</code> function in it parses the command line, and usually you expect to run it with a command such as:</p>

<pre><code>python setup.py py2exe
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>py2exe</code> is a command that the py2exe package understands and then builds the EXE file. So as long as the py2exe package is installed, that command should be accepted.</p>

<p>The line <code>sys.argv.append("py2exe")</code> adds that command to the command-line, so in your case you should just be able to type:</p>

<pre><code>python p2e_simple_con.py
</code></pre>

<p>to build the exe. However, if you haven't installed the py2exe package, then the base <code>distutils</code> wouldn't recognise the <code>py2exe</code> command. But in that case, I'd expect you to get an exception for the line <code>import py2exe</code>. So, I'm not sure what's going on.</p>

<p>What is the command you used to run the setup program?</p>
^^
<p>Is <code>item</code> an array in the url like <code>item[]</code>? If it's not that's the reason you get that error, you cannot iterate through a non-iterator object!</p>

<p>Also get rid of the single quotes around the values if they are numeric and use string concatenation,</p>

<pre><code>"UPDATE userprojectlist SET category_display_order = " . $key . " WHERE category_id = " . $value . ";"

<p>In theory the program should run exactly the same as on a physical machine.</p>

<p>In practice however, there may be differences due to </p>

<ul>
<li>Machine\OS configuration and drivers</li>
<li>Load of the virtual machine host.</li>
</ul>

<p>Differences in machine configuration are similar to difference you would see between any difference physical machine.   Depending on how critical you application is to the end user, you should run the same set of tests that you would a physical box to determine whether the environment is acceptable for use.</p>

<p>Depending on the virtualisation technology, the host may not have the ability to guarantee the client resources at specific times.  This can lead to weird behavior on the client.  Potentially you would see more occurrences of application errors due to IO timeouts an starvation of memory.</p>

<p>To successfully virtualise an application for production use you need to do a bit of work to understand the resource profile of the application\client and virtual host.</p>

<p>After Lasse discovered that the FindAll method was generating the wrong IL, I then came across another method that was also generating the wrong IL -- I also found the root cause and resolution.</p>

<p>The relevant line in the second method is:</p>

<pre><code>var policy = Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy(dependentKeys, true);
</code></pre>

<p>Cache is my own object. The GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy method returns a System.Runtime.Caching.CacheItemPolicy object. The generated IL, however, looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt; policy = (Func&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt;) base.Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy(dependentKeys, true);
</code></pre>

<p>There are two projects in play here. The methods that are generating the wrong IL are in one project called DomainModel, and the Cache object is in a Utilities project, which is referenced by the first. The second project contains a reference to System.Runtime.Caching but the first does not.</p>

<p>The fix was to add a reference to System.Runtime.Caching to the first project. Now the generated IL looks correct:</p>

<pre><code>CacheItemPolicy policy = base.Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy(dependentKeys, true);
</code></pre>

<p>The first method (that Lasse posted about in his answer) now also generates proper IL.</p>

<p>Hooray!</p>

<p>Johannes has mentioned the main issues with your current approach.</p>

<p>It is possible to do form alpha blending in Windows Forms but you will need to use the Windows API call (among others): <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633556%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">UpdateLayeredWindow</a>.</p>

<p>I tried using tight looping for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3270120/javascript-jquery-how-to-make-sure-cross-domain-click-tracking-event-succeeds-be">this</a>. I needed to slow down a native event (which AFAIK is the only use case for a synchronous wait that can't be re-architected asynchronously). There are lots of example loops out there that claim not to lock up the browser; but none of them worked for me (the browser didn't lock up, but they prevented it from doing the thing I was waiting for in the first place), so I abandoned the idea.</p>

<p>Next I tried <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3278300/javascript-how-to-trigger-native-click-action-replay-event-later">this</a> - storing and replaying the event, which seems to be impossible cross-browser too. However depending on the event and how flexible you need to be, you can get close.</p>

<p>I would look into clustering the web end immediately and use that as your primary scaling mechanism. 30k connections is quite a lot and you don't have much room for growth before you hit a server limit of some kind. If the I/O itself isn't onerous I would just use lots of threads and servers with lots of horsepower and memory. Get it working that way so you can ship, and have a fallback plan to switch to multiplexed NIO if performance or scaling becomes a problem, but be warned that it's a radical overhaul and about ten times as complex to program as java.net. After several years' consideration I am more and more wondering whether NIO to economize on threads is really worth it: it adds several new problems of its own such as a need for push parsing; synchronization issues with the selector if there are worker threads that need to change the registration state of channels; lots of ways to get the code wrong; and the fact that the scheduling overhead moves out of the OS into your application, where you only have linear set-iterator data structures to deal with it unless you engage in yet another level of complexity. It's worth remembering that <em>select()</em> was invented for Unix to allow economizing on processes, which are expensive. Threads are pretty cheap really, and provide a very simple programming model with built-in context for handling a single connection. NIO barely manages this at all except via disciplined use of selection key attachments, much less naturally.</p>

<p>First, the business layer (BL) can and should reside in its' own plugin. That will provide decent decoupling between the layers.</p>

<p>Second, you should carefully decide what the interface should be and which classes are exposed. Ideally, you should mostly expose interfaces and data objects. </p>

<p>Finally, decide how the "hand shake" works. E.g., how to obtain the initial interface to the BL. Since it is a Plugin, it could have an Activator which loads it. You could add a method in the activator which returns the BL interface.</p>

<p>If you are looking for something more decoupled, you could create an extension point or deploy the BL as an OSGi service, but that's a bit of an overkill for you need. </p>

<p>For Python2.6+, before Python 3.0, the former creates an old-style class while the latter creates a new-style class. In Python 3.0, both create a new-style. The first isn't wrong, but for anything before 3.0 it has different semantics than the latter and is typically discouraged.</p>

<p>I'm playing around with building C# app, really new in C#. What I'm trying to do is; make the app periodically read the content of a text file (in one or two words only). The content of the text file will be handled by other mean, so no issue on that. I'm displaying the content on the Text of System.Windows.Forms.Label(). Right now, it works on Click or HandleCreated event. But I want it to automatically read and display the content in every, say, 2 minutes.</p>

<p>I looked at <a href="http://www.programmingforums.org/post40069.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2928656/c-periodic-data-reading-and-thread-sleep">this</a> but not really sure how to implement it on my case. Anyone can help? Thanks!</p>

<p>Some people find that the directory 
~/Library/Autosave Information
is owned by root, and so files can not be written therein. See for example 
<a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2252306" rel="nofollow">http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2252306</a></p>

<p>I don't know how the bug arises but I was bitten by it -- the directory was created 2010-06-17 12:19 and I assume that the permissions were wrong from that moment. </p>

<p>FYI: As far as I found from my shallow research with .NET reflector, it seems that the ElementName search searches from the current element upwards, so it's better using RelativeSource and AncestorType (FindAncestor mode).<br>

<p>Create a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.timer.aspx" rel="nofollow">System.Forms.Timer</a>, set interval to 2 minutes and handle the timer tick event.</p>

<pre><code>   // Declare at form class scope
   System.Windows.Forms.Timer myTimer = new System.Windows.Forms.Timer();

   // ...

   myTimer.Tick += new EventHandler(TimerEventProcessor);

   // Sets the timer interval to 120 seconds (2 minutes).
   myTimer.Interval = 120000;
   myTimer.Start();

<p>Place the calls to the methods to read the file and display it in <code>TimerEventProcessor</code>.</p>

<p>Blow, you should keep <strong>performance issues</strong> when choosing some kind of inheritance strategy. <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Inheritance" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you can see a good insight about available inheritance strategies. Do not forget a inheritance can be re-writen as a association as follows</p>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>public class A {}

public class B extends A {}
</code></pre>

<p>you can use</p>

<pre><code>public class B {

    private A a;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can use MapedSuperClass To map all of your inherited properties whitout using any Hibernate/JPA inheritance strategy. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2700680/table-per-subclass-inheritance-relationship-how-to-query-against-the-parent-clas/3017146#3017146">here</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind when using default JPA/Hibernate annotations, Hibernate always fetch all of subclasses. If you have a <strong>single hierarchy</strong>, prefer To use Single Table Inheritance strategy. Joined strategy is better designed when you have a <strong>complex hierarchy</strong> but it suffers due To performance issues when querying for any entity.</p>

<p>Because it doesn't make any sense. Instance variables are associated with an instance of the class. Static methods aren't. Which instance's variables would you be talking about within the static method?</p>

<p>Use the format operator <code>%</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '#%02x%02x%02x' % (0, 128, 64)
'#008040'
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it won't check bounds...</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; '#%02x%02x%02x' % (0, -1, 9999)
'#00-1270f'
</code></pre>
^^
<p>That is a bad thing to be trying to do.  If you don't know what the generic type is going to be, how do you know if passing a <code>String</code> is type-safe?</p>

<p>If you really want to do this, you have to add the appropriate annotation to the <code>exec</code> method to tell it to suppress the unsafe/unchecked type conversion error.  But that is just turning the compilation into a potential <code>ClassCastException</code> at runtime that might be thrown unexpectedly by some subtype of <code>ExecContext</code> that does something different in the <code>doSomething</code> method.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I don't think that the following is correct either:</p>

<pre><code>    public static &lt;T&gt; void exec(ExecContext&lt;T&gt; ctx) {
        String s = new String("saoj");
        ctx.doSomething(s);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>because the compiler cannot tell that the actual type used for <code>T</code> will be <code>String</code> or a (hypothetical) subtype of <code>String</code>.  Suppose for instance that <code>exec</code> was called as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    ExecContext&lt;Integer&gt; ctx = ...;
    exec(ctx);
</code></pre>

<p>Now when <code>exec</code> calls the <code>doSomething</code> method, it will pass a <code>String</code> instance as an argument, where the generic signature of the <code>doSomething</code> method says it should be passing an instance of <code>E</code>; i.e. an <code>Integer</code>.</p>
^^
<p>I found the problem , For Update like that , It's necessary to have primary key . The reason my table didn't have primary key was : I imported those data from an Excel file , So i didn't have Primary key .</p>

<p>On a different tack, there are two other aspects to consider, that may help.</p>

<p>1) Indexes and the indexes used by the SQL.  The indexing strategy used on the tables will affect how many rows are affected.  If you make the data modifications using a unique index, you may reduce the chance of deadlocks.</p>

<p>One algorithm - of course it will not work it all cases.  The use of NOLOCK is targeted rather than being global.</p>

<pre><code>The "old" way:
UPDATE dbo.change_table
   SET somecol = newval
 WHERE non_unique_value = 'something'

The "new" way:
INSERT INTO #temp_table
    SELECT uid FROM dbo.change_table WITH (NOLOCK)
     WHERE non_unique_value = 'something'

UPDATE dbo.change_table
   SET somecol = newval
  FROM dbo.change_table c
       INNER JOIN
       #temp_table t
       ON (c.uid = t.uid)
</code></pre>

<p>2) Transaction duration
The longer a transaction is open the more likely there may be contention.  If there is a way to reduce the amount of time that records remain locked, you can reduce the chances of a deadlock occurring.
For example, perform as many SELECT statements (e.g. lookups) at the start of the code instead of performing an INSERT or UPDATE, then a lookup, then an INSERT, and then another lookup.
This is where one can use the NOLOCK hint for SELECTs on "static" tables that are not changing reducing the lock "footprint" of the code.</p>

<p>Hi, I have come across with the following two codes. Why does it not throw an exception for floating point where as in other case it will throw a runtime exception.</p>

       }
    }

<p>This will not work because the you are passing the ExecContext (of type unknown) so you don't know at compile what type the ExecutionContext holds.</p>

<p>You will have to do this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Test {

     public static class ExecContext&lt;E&gt; {

         public void doSomething(E e) {

             System.out.println(e);
         }
     }

     public static void exec(ExecContext&lt;Object&gt; ctx) {

         String s = new String("saoj");

         ctx.doSomething(s); // &lt;============== NO COMPILE ERROR
     }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Any way whats the point of generics if you are passing the execution context of unknown or object?</p>

<pre><code>def clamp(x): 
  return max(0, min(x, 255))

"#{0:02x}{1:02x}{2:02x}".format(clamp(r), clamp(g), clamp(b))
</code></pre>

<p>This uses the preferred method of string formatting, as <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/" rel="nofollow">described in PEP 3101</a>. It also uses <code>min()</code> and <code>max</code> to ensure that <code>0 &lt;= {r,g,b} &lt;= 255</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> added the clamp function as suggested below.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> From the title of the question and the context given, it should be obvious that this expects 3 ints in [0,255] and will always return a color when passed 3 such ints. However, from the comments, this may not be obvious to everyone, so let it be explicitly stated: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Provided three <code>int</code> values, this will return a valid hex triplet representing a color. If those values are between [0,255], then it will treat those as RGB values and return the color corresponding to those values.</em></p>

^^
<p>Because floats actually <em>have</em> a representation for the "number" you're trying to calculate. So it uses that. An integer has no such representation.</p>

<p>Java (mostly) follows IEEE754 for its floating point support, see <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/typesValues.html#4.2.3" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more details.</p>

<p>I'm looking at installing atmail as a replacement to my home-grown system for internal member-to-member emails on my website.</p>

<p>Currently, these messages are kept in mysql.</p>

<p>All of the IMAP servers I've come across keep emails on the filesystem, I'm guessing there are allot of good reasons that there are not many implementations using mysql as a back end out there.</p>

<p>As far as manageability goes though, I think mysql is the way to go for my site... There are many more tools available for interacting with mysql than for instance mbox files.</p>

<p>Hello again...</p>

<p>I have a widget which is a TimePicker that retrieves the time saved in a field in a database.</p>

<p>Thing is that when the user changes the time value in the widget, this is not being saved in the database.</p>

<p>So I came across the <strong>setOnTimeChangedListener</strong> method that works like a charm, if you are only using the plus and minus signs in the widget.  It does not capture the change if you are using the keyword.</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>pickedTime.setOnTimeChangedListener(new TimePicker.OnTimeChangedListener() {

        public void onTimeChanged(TimePicker arg0, int arg1, int arg2) {
            System.out.println("What time is it? "
                    + String.valueOf(arg0.getCurrentHour()) + ":"
                    + String.valueOf(arg0.getCurrentMinute()));
        }

    });
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried unsuccessfully:</p>

<p><strong>pickedTime.setOnFocusChangeListener</strong> and <strong>pickedTime.setOnKeyListener</strong> methods.  </p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Looking for 401 codes won't reliably catch them as sites might not produce links to anything you don't have privileges for. That is, until you are logged in, it won't show you anything you need to log in for. OTOH some sites (ones with all static content for example) manage to pop a login dialog box for some pages so looking for password input tags would also miss stuff.</p>

<p>My advice: find a spider program that you can get source for, add in whatever tests (plural) you plan on using and make it stop of the first positive result. Look for a spider that can be throttled <em>way</em> back, can ignore non HTML files (maybe by making HEAD requests and looking at the mime type) and can work with more than one site independently and simultaneously.</p>

<p>Consider using the REVERSE function.  If you reverse the string, then the position of the first space in the reversed string can be subtracted from the length of the normal string to calculate the starting position of NNN/MMM.</p>

<p>The method has worked well for me for parsing file paths.  Reversing the string and looking for the first "\" in the reversed string indicates where the path ends and the file name begins.</p>

<p>If your data is as well formatted as you indicate, this method may be more trouble than some  others.  But when the beginning data is "haphazard", this method can really simplify things.</p>

<p>This is because the compiler is implicitly declaring a copy constructor for class <code>foo</code>. <code>std::wstringstream</code> is noncopyable, because it inherits from <code>ios_base</code>.</p>

<p>Change your class to this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;sstream&gt;

class foo
{
  public:
    void methodA(int x, int y); // Uses mBufferStream
    void methodB(int x, int y); // Uses mBufferStream

  private:
    std::wstringstream mBufferStream;
    foo(const foo&amp;); //noncopyable
    void operator=(const foo&amp;)
};

<p>The project compiles fine. I was trying simple </p>

<pre><code>printf("Hello world");
</code></pre>

<p>But When I ran in smart phone 2003 emulator, it showed no output.</p>

<p>I couldn't find a good tutorial to start from. Please suggest me some good tutorials or sample applications to start from. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>In the timer event mentioned in another answer, I expect you will want to read the file every time, even if some other process is currently locking the file.  </p>

<p>But if you don't take precautions you will receive an exception whenever the file is in use. You can catch this exception of course, but you will then need to simply wait for a few seconds before trying again.  If the file is still locked you may need to implement some timeout mechanism.</p>

<p>If this is not what you want, another approach that supports reading of (possibly) locked files is to use a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filestream.aspx" rel="nofollow">FileStream</a> object created with the FileShare.ReadWrite parameter:</p>

<pre><code>        // Inside your timer event.
        using (System.IO.FileStream fs = new System.IO.FileStream("yourfile.log", 
               System.IO.FileMode.Open, System.IO.FileAccess.Read, 
               System.IO.FileShare.ReadWrite))
        {
            // use fs to read from file as required
        }

<p>im using Sphinx and i have configured my gammar model path which is build\class\FYP</p>

<p>but in my configuration file i just wanted to put FYP in the configuration component</p>

<p>as follow</p>

<pre><code> &lt;component name="jsgfGrammar" type="edu.cmu.sphinx.jsapi.JSGFGrammar"&gt;
    &lt;property name="dictionary" value="dictionary"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="grammarLocation"
         value="resource:/FYP/"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="grammarName" value="word"/&gt;
&lt;property name="logMath" value="logMath"/&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>but when i want to deploy the application the said folder cleans and the deployed jar file is not working because of it misses this grammar model. </p>

<p>this is the path 
C:\Users\Pradeep\Documents\NetBeansProjects\FYPApplication11</p>

<p>which has the grammar model at the moment. </p>

<p>but when i put like this </p>

<pre><code> &lt;component name="jsgfGrammar" type="edu.cmu.sphinx.jsapi.JSGFGrammar"&gt;
    &lt;property name="dictionary" value="dictionary"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="grammarLocation"
         value="resource:/C:\Users\Pradeep\Documents\NetBeansProjects\FYPApplication11/"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="grammarName" value="word"/&gt;
&lt;property name="logMath" value="logMath"/&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or using </p>

<p>\ lines also didnt work</p>

<p>can someone help me to make this project to deploy as a jar file. because of this path issue the application is not working when i deploy in Netbeans</p>
^^
<p>Scott,</p>

<p>I just saw your posting and I know it's a little old, but if you still need to solve your issue the upcoming version of Viewpoint has delegate access integrated into it.  You can get it today by cloning the github repo.  </p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/zenchild/Viewpoint" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/zenchild/Viewpoint</a></p>

<p>If you take a look the README file it talks about it a bit, but if you need additional help send me a message on github or stackoverflow and I'll help you out.</p>

<p>I have a table in emacs and I am trying to narrow some of the columns, say by 7 characters. I tried to do this by using <kbd>C-7</kbd> <kbd>M-x</kbd> <code>table-narrow-cell</code> command. However, it says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Variable binding depth exceeds max-specpdl-size</p>

<p>Does anyone know what I need to do? Do I need to change something in the <code>.emacs</code> file?</p>

<p>ok here is the code</p>

<pre><code>  - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {

        Book *aBook = [appDelegate.books objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]; i need this to get id form XMLa

        **uuidd=aBook.uniqueId;** this i need 

        if(bdvController == nil)


        //  Book *aBook = [appDelegate.books objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];

<p>alright first off i will say that im definitely newer to android programming than most.. i think that i am picking up quite quickly however i think that the program that im looking to eventually create is a bit out of my league right now considering my level of knowledge.. im hoping someone here can either tell me what i need to do so i can do my research and start working or maybe even provide me with some sample source code to work from</p>

<p>i have figured out how to do everything in my android program except for creating a list that is populated by an internet file that i update and maintain on a daily basis.. i dont care what file type it is.. i can learn to use whatever if it gets the job done.. the program reads the information from the file, properly splits it up into an array (multiple actually considering there are multiple parts that accompany each item in the list), and creates the list with the items - each of which are clickable and sends you to a separate page/activity with the full information of that item that you clicked on</p>

<p>any help with this would be greatly greatly appreciated</p>

<p>As André said, you may want to implement an HttpResponse filter. Alternatively to configuring the filter in the web.config file, you can also implement the following in the global.asax.cs file:</p>

<pre><code>  protected void Application_BeginRequest() {
     Response.Filter = new PassThroughFilter(Response.Filter);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>PassThroughFilter</code> class derives from Stream and implements the abstract methods, then forwards them to the original filter.</p>

<p>Let's say we define an anonymous hash like this:</p>

<pre><code>my $hash = {};
</code></pre>

<p>And then use the hash afterwards. Then it's time to empty or clear the hash for
reuse. After some Google searching, I found:</p>

<pre><code>%{$hash} = () 
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>undef %{$hash}
</code></pre>

<p>Both will serve my needs. My question is, what's the difference between the two? Are they both identical ways to empty a hash?</p>

<p>I'm trying to create a rdlc report in Visual Studio 2008 and I'm having a bit of trouble with the totals at the end.</p>

<p>I have a string field called "Reward" that displays either 1, 2, 3 or B.  At the end of the report, I need to count up how many total records, how many "B"s and how many are not "B"s.  So my inclination is to have three fields at the bottom as such:</p>

<pre><code>Total      =COUNT(IIF(Fields!Reward.Value &gt; "a",1,0))
Bs         =COUNT(IIF(Fields!Reward.Value = "B",1,0))
Non-Bs     =COUNT(IIF(Fields!Reward.Value &lt;&gt; "B",1,0))
</code></pre>

<p>But all three end up equaling the same (the total record count).  I thought that seemed weird so I tried data that doesn't appear in that column at all such as </p>

<pre><code>=COUNT(IIF(Fields!Reward.Value = "4",1,0))
</code></pre>

<p>and I still get the same number.  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?</p>
^^
<p>It's possible at 4.0, using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd267698.aspx" rel="nofollow">Zip</a> (that's the definition of zip - combining elements on the same position):</p>

<pre><code>double[] Z = X.Zip(Y, (x, y) =&gt; x * y).ToArray();

<p>On 3.5 you can use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/morelinq/" rel="nofollow">MoreLinq</a>, which has a custom Zip extension method.</p>

<p>What does the log say? That the application has terminated successfully with return code 0x0?</p>

<p>If you did not put anything to stop the application it might be that it runs good and terminates without you noticing it. Try to add a <code>scanf</code> or <code>Sleep(5000)</code> after the <code>printf</code> statement so things will be visible. You can also compile it in <code>debug</code> mode and put a breakpoint after the printf statement and see the results.</p>

<p>In addition, I am not too familiar with Windows Mobile and its incarnations (smart phone 2003 being one of them), but I am not sure how it handles a <code>printf</code>. You can try create an MFC application and use the <code>MessageBox</code> to display your text.</p>

<hr>

<p>OK. I just tried the two options and there is no CMD windows in Windows Mobile (Smartphone or PocketPC) so the application runs successfully, but prints nothing.</p>

<p>Use the MFC option or deploy your application to a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=a120e012-ca31-4be9-a3bf-b9bf4f64ce72&amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">Windows CE 5.0 device emulator</a> image. I have not tried that download myself, but it says that it should save you the hassle of handling Platform Builder. Note that you might be missing some components in the image down the road, but I suppose that for practicing purposes it should suite you just fine.</p>

<p>If the function is actually going to modify the string, you'd better create a separate copy:</p>

<pre><code>std::string str = // ...
char* cstr = strdup(str.c_str());
MyMethod(cstr);
// If you want to preserve the changes made:
// str = cstr;
free(cstr);
</code></pre>

<p>In C is there a branch-less technique to compute the absolute difference between two unsigned ints? For example given the variables a and b, I would like the value 2 for cases when a=3, b=5 or b=3, a=5. Ideally I would also like to be able to vectorize the computation using the SSE registers.</p>
^^
<p>I hope one of these RCS's will add narrow clone capability.  My understanding is that the architecture of GIT (changes/moves tracked across the whole repo) makes this very difficult.</p>

<p>Bazaar prides itself on supporting many different types of workflows.  Lack of narrow clone capability prohibits an SVN/CVS like workflow in bzr/hg/git, so I'm hoping they'll be motivated to find some way to do this.</p>

<p>New features shouldn't come at the expense of basic functionality, like the ability to fetch a single file/directory from the repo.  The "distributed" feature of modern rcs's is "cool," but in my opinion discourages good development practices (frequent merges / continuous integration).  These new RCS's all seem to lack very basic functionality.  Even SVN without real branching/tagging support seemed like a step backwards from CVS imo.</p>
^^
<p>The exception indicates that you're missing some classes (one or more JAR files, presumably) when you run your program, though they're either irrelevant to compiling it or they <em>are</em> available then.</p>

<p>You should also note that the first line in <code>appendDb</code> accomplishes nothing. It builds a new <code>List</code> by consing <code>database</code> onto the front of the <code>List</code> referred to by <code>db</code>, but the resulting value is discarded. Perhaps you meant this:</p>

<pre><code>  db = database :: db
</code></pre>
^^
<p>You might try using cURL and just attempting to connect to each site in turn (possibly put them in a text file and read each line, try to connect, repeat). </p>

<p>You can set up one of the callbacks to check the HTTP response code and do whatever you need from there.</p>
^^
<p>Since your question is tagged jQuery here's a slightly shorter answer using that library:</p>

<pre><code>function copy(from, to) {
    from.children().each(function() {
      var match = to.children("." + this.className.split(' ').join('.'));
        if(match.length) {
            if(match.children().length == 0) {
                match.replaceWith(this);
            } else {
                copy($(this), match);
            }
        } else {
            to.append(this);
        }
    }).end().remove();
    from.remove();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you'd just call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>copy($(".container1"), $(".container2"));
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/nick_craver/BMUPu/" rel="nofollow">You can give it a try here</a>, the result is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="container container2"&gt;
  &lt;div class="cars"&gt;
    &lt;div class="sedans"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="vans"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="drinks"&gt;
    &lt;div class="soda"&gt;coke&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="coffee"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="juice"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="colors"&gt;
    &lt;div class="blue"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="red"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the class name is still <code>container2</code> if you want to replace that just add this  to switch the class after the <code>copy()</code> call:</p>

<pre><code>$(".container2").toggleClass("container2 container-result");
</code></pre>

<p>The match is based on all classes the element contains, so if an element has <code>class="car blue"</code> and there's a corresponding <code>class="blue car"</code> it'll choose that one to overwrite.</p>

<p>This isn't the most efficient route since you're firing up the selector engine on the children each iteration, but unless you're doing <em>lots</em> of elements, it should be pretty quick.</p>

<p>I want to have a browser page which shows the video from both a local and a remote IP based web cam simultaneously. </p>

<p>It will also have a few standard HTML form elemts and a "submit" button for user control of the local camera, etc</p>

<p>It may later also need show the output of a remote data measurement device, recevied locally over RS232.</p>

<p>Now, I presoanlly prefer server side solutions (YMMV), because users can turn off JS, or even edit it if they are mailicious or stupid. Can I do it in PHP? I know PHP reasonably well, so that would save me learnnig a new language. I am just a little worried about refreshing the page for that remote measurement data. </p>

<p>It has to be cross-platform, which is why I am thinking browser based. Can I do it browser-based, or should I go with Java, or what?</p>

<p>Looking for password fields will get you so far, but won't help with sites that use HTTP authentication. Looking for 401s will help with HTTP authentication, but won't get you sites that don't use it, or ones that don't return 401. Looking for links like "log in" or "username" fields will get you some more.</p>

<p>I don't think that you'll be able to do this entirely automatically and be sure that you're actually detecting all the password-protected areas.</p>

<p>You'll probably want to take a library that is good at web automation, and write a little program yourself that reads the list of target sites from a file, checks each one, and writes to one file of "these are definitely passworded" and "these are not", and then you might want to go manually check the ones that are not, and make modifications to your program to accomodate. Using httrack is great for grabbing data, but it's not going to help with detection -- if you write your own "check for password protected area" program with a general purpose HLL, you can do more checks, and you can avoid generating more requests per site than would be necessary to determine that a password-protected area exists.</p>

<p>You may need to ignore robots.txt</p>

<p>I recommend using <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/" rel="nofollow">the python port of perls mechanize</a>, or whatever nice web automation library your preferred language has. Almost all modern languages will have a nice library for opening and searching through web pages, and looking at HTTP headers.</p>

<p>If you are not capable of  writing this yourself, you're going to have a rather difficult time using httrack or wget or similar and then searching through responses.</p>

<p>so you could actually ask daniel or on that mailing list.</p>

<p>in terms of diagnosing the hang I suppose you could use strace or what not to see where it's hanging.  Also running with 1.9 might help as you can set certain C calls a "non blocking" in binary extensions.

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s1wwdcbf.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>String</code></a> has a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dy85x1sa.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Contains</code></a> method that should suffice, returns a <code>boolean</code></p>

<pre><code>"Big string that represents a paragraph".Contains("that");
</code></pre>

<p>Example from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dy85x1sa.aspx" rel="nofollow">Contains Method MSDN page</a>:</p>

<pre><code>// This example demonstrates the String.Contains() method
using System;

class Sample 
{
    public static void Main() 
    {
    string s1 = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
    string s2 = "fox";
    bool b;
    b = s1.Contains(s2);
    Console.WriteLine("Is the string, s2, in the string, s1?: {0}", b);
    }
}
/*
This example produces the following results:

Is the string, s2, in the string, s1?: True
*/

<p>If you need more advanced matching then Regex might be the correct route, but from the example you stated I think contains will work fine.</p>

<p>Hi, on Git, say I mess up my commits, and I want to make the version 3 commits ago as the new version. If I do "git checkout xxxx", it creates a new branch and it seems like I can only merge it? Could I make this the new "master version"?</p>

<p>I want:</p>

<pre><code>A-B-C-D-E
</code></pre>

<p>to become</p>

<pre><code>A-B-C-D-E-F
</code></pre>

<p>where F has exactly the same content as C</p>

<p>If I use "git revert xxxx" instead, it seems like it definitely will have conflicts and I need to manually resolve it. What I really want is just make the old commit at some point the new commit, irregardless of what's in my working directory or the latest commit. How would I go about doing this? Thank you.</p>

<p>The Luhn algorithm might be of interest to you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm</a></p>

<p>It validates a credit-card number by using the checksum algorithm.</p>

<p>From the wiki page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The formula verifies a number against
  its included check digit, which is
  usually appended to a partial account
  number to generate the full account
  number. This account number must pass
  the following test:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Counting from the check digit, which is the rightmost, and moving
  left, double the value of every second
  digit.</li>
  <li>Sum the digits of the products together with the undoubled digits
  from the original number.</li>
  <li>If the total ends in 0 (put another way, if the total modulo 10 is
  equal to 0), then the number is valid
  according to the Luhn formula; else it
  is not valid.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Assume an example of an account number
  "4992739871" that will have a check
  digit added, making it of the form
  4992739871x:</p>

<p>There are multiple different types of databases, but typically not. More commonly, you would have a single table, but with a field that designates the user ID. In MySQL, you can select the subset of rows for which the user ID matches  a specific value, which is kind of like dynamically creating a per-user table.</p>
^^
<p>You can look in the c code (array.c)
if it calls any ruby method calls (rb_funcall) then it's not thread safe, I believe.  Otherwise it should be...</p>

<p>You could easily override #pop et al and make them have their own synchronization.</p>
^^
<p>Why would each user have their own table?  A user should simply be an entry in a table.  You then use the id of that user to look up other records in other tables.</p>

<p>If you database contained sy 6 tables then each time you added a user youd also have to add the other tables again too.</p>

<p>so now you have 10 users and 60 tables.</p>

<p>While interviewing for a company, I was asked to submit several code samples that highlight my "best" work. I was pinged back with several questions regarding a specific code sample, one of which alluded to a bug.</p>

<p>The code sample was a WCF Web service that uses AES to encrypt an opaque blob. The blob is used by the service to identify all resources for a specific service request. The bug was that the .NET RijndaelManaged class was used with CBC mode, without properly setting the IV. The RijndaelManaged class will autogenerate an appropriate IV during class instantiation, which in the code sample, occurs during first usage of encryption, and is persisted for the life of the ASP .NET Application. Since ASP.NET applications can be restarted for a variety of reasons, it's possible that a these opaque blobs would be "invalidated" from one service call to the next because of a new IV value generated during App startup (the bug).</p>

<p>The question itself was "where is IV set for decryption?"</p>

<p>My response is already to admit that this is a bug; but since they asked for my "best" work, <strong>am I SOL on this position for having submitted a sample with a bug? Is there more I can say?</strong></p>

<p>I'm hesitant to outline the situation because I don't want to seem like I'm making an excuse, but the encryption code was turned off while our service was in pre-alpha, and the project was killed before we ever went into production.</p>

<p>It sounds like you just want to reset to C; that is make the tree:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A-B-C</p>

<p>You can do that with <code>reset</code>:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~3

<p><sub>(Note: You said three commits ago so that's what I wrote; in your example C is only two commits ago, so you might want to use <code>HEAD~2</code>)</sub></p>

<p>You can also use <code>revert</code> if you want, although as far as I know you need to do the reverts one at a time:</p>

<pre><code>git revert HEAD     # Reverts E
git revert HEAD~2   # Reverts D
</code></pre>

<p>That will create a new commit F that's the same contents as D, and G that's the same contents as C. You can <code>rebase</code> to squash those together if you want</p>

<p>I have a simple program that lets you add, edit, list, search and delete records by storing it on arrays.</p>

<p>My problem now, is how to properly delete items on it. Here is my current code. </p>

<pre><code>System.out.print("Input number to delete: ");
                    delnum=scanz.nextLine();
                    intdelnum=Integer.parseInt(delnum);

 name[intdelnum]=null;
                            course[intdelnum]=null;
                            gender[intdelnum]=null;
                            school[intdelnum]=null;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, if I list this array which contains 10 elements each. The array index which Ive set to  null, will remain null forever. And I cannot add anything on it. 
Do you know of a better way on how to do this. So that when I delete the array element at index 2. The element at index 3 will go up. to index 2? So that later I could still add an element on the index which I've set to null.</p>

<p>Another important difference between the Zend Engine and a typical JVM is in the way they execute bytecodes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Zend Engine executes (interprets) the compiled bytecodes directly.  (At least that's what I think happens.  I wasn't able to confirm this from the Zend online documentation!)</li>
<li>A JVM will normally use a JIT compiler to compile bytecodes to native instructions, and then execute the native instructions.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Actually, JVM behaviour is more complicated than this.  JVMs don't always compile to native code, and when they do, they typically delay JIT compilation until they figure it is worth doing.  Prior to that, they execute the bytecodes directly.</p>

<p>This is just an idea (not really an answer but I can't comment).</p>

<p>Since it seems from the error message that there is a parameter given to <code>py2exe</code> that it doesn't accept, I'd guess it's the <code>-q</code> parameter. So try removing the line <code>sys.argv.append("-q")</code> and run the scrip then. </p>

<p>I haven't used py2exe myself so I can't really test this. It's just an idea.</p>

Now load the new project from either the 'Project Manager' > 'Load Project' or the menu Project. You can now work with all the classes, functions and variables listed in Zend Framework inside phpDesigner 7.

<p>Q1> which library folder I should provide for phpDesigner?
I found the following two folders under my machine
C:\Program Files\Zend\ZendServer\GUI\library
C:\Program Files\Zend\ZendServer\share\ZendFramework\library</p>

<p>Q2> It seems that the home directory is

<p>Alright, this pretty much goes along with my previous question. I'm still trying to figure out how to display data from an array which is created by a PHP file- using JS/jQuery. I'm working on a points system for ZetaBoards, and I've currently got it set up <a href="http://s1.zetaboards.com/RyJoe/index/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. (Points will be displayed below the users post count once I get this working.. you guys can't see the +/- functions which work fine, haha. :p )</p>

<p><a href="http://outlinetokens.hostei.com/scripts/output.php" rel="nofollow">http://outlinetokens.hostei.com/scripts/output.php</a></p>

<p>So, for each user- I can get their user ID, I just don't know how to check if their name is in the array. (and if it is, display their points) I'm guessing I'll have to do something like this? Here's the chunk of the code that deals with this.. you'll see where I need help.</p>

<pre><code>if (location.href.match('/topic/')) {
    $.getScript('http://outlinetokens.hostei.com/scripts/output.php', function () {
        $('td.c_username a.member').each(function () {
            value = 0;
            u = $(this).attr('href').split('profile/')[1].split('/')[0];

            // this is where I need to do the 'search.' Just a basic guess.. help. D:

            if (values.uid == u) {
                value = values.points;
            }

            $(this).parents('tr').next().find('dl.user_info').append('&lt;dt&gt;' + options.system_name + ':&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class="Points"&gt;&lt;span id="point_total"&gt;' + value + '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;');

also important that you add:</p>

<p>You could do it manually by shifting the array contents around, or by using an array copying call like <code>System.arraycopy</code>, but you almost certainly want to use a collection instead. <a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ArrayList</code></a> is a good choice for a mutable array. <a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html#remove(int)" rel="nofollow"><code>ArrayList.remove</code></a> will let you remove by index:</p>

<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;...&gt; name, course, gender, school;

intdelnum = Integer.parseInt(delnum);
name.remove(intdelnum);
course.remove(intdelnum);
gender.remove(intdelnum);
school.remove(intdelnum);

<p>Some other random notes about your code snippet:</p>

<p>I'm assuming <code>scanz</code> is a Scanner. You can call <code>nextInt()</code> on it instead of using <code>nextLine()</code> and converting the String to an int.</p>

<p>You also probably want to make a class that holds all that information, instead of using four parallel arrays to track it:</p>

<pre><code>class Student {
    enum Gender {MALE, FEMALE}

    private String name;
    private Course course; // This can be a String if that's simpler for your project
    private Gender gender;
    private School school; // See note for 'course'

<p>I'm doing a homework assignment where I need to display an image and then allow the user to resize the image witha JSlider. I have the image displaying, but Im not sure how I could use a slider to change the size. As I understand sliders, there are 3 parameters that control the default value, the max slider value, and the min slider value.</p>

<p>Could I reference these numbers in some kind of equation that determines what dimensions to set the image at??</p>

<p>Also, I need scrollbars if the image is bigger than the frame. currently my scrollbars will show up but the image will still stretch the frame to just below the size of the image. is there somewhere i can set the dimension limits for the scrolling? this is what I'm trying unsuccessfully at the moment:</p>

<pre><code>JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(image);
        scrollPane.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(500,500));
        scrollPane.setBounds(frame.getWidth()-image.getWidth(), 0, frame.getHeight()-image.getHeight(), frame.getHeight());
        frame.add(scrollPane);

<p>You can't resize the array once it is created.<br>
You can create a  List  from the array like <code>Arrays.asList()</code>, use <code>remove()</code> to remove elements you don't want and then use <code>toArray()</code> to get back an array from the List.</p>

<p>As I understand it you have two problems here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Because of the new sorting code in JTable, your sorting does not work.</li>
<li>Even if you disable sorting by <code>setRowSorter(null)</code> or by overriding the <code>setRowSorter(TableRowsorter)</code> to do nothing, it does not work because the events on header are not passed to your JTable.</li>
</ol>

<p>In that case I think the option for you is to just <strong>have your sorting code implemented as TableRowSorter</strong>. I am not aware how complex your sorting code is and whether it can map the TableRowSorter API, but this seems to be one more alternative you can try.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say it would damage your monitor since there are programs that do this in an attempt to fix dead pixels. I can't remember any off the top of my head since I haven't used one in 3 years. </p>

<p>Your post is pretty vague, but based on what you said I'd create a model for Company that has_many users.</p>

<p>Making sure that each user could only see data from their company would be as simple as limiting the data results to that company.  Your index could look like:</p>

<pre><code> before_filter :current_company
    def index
      @data = @current_company.data.find(:all)
      respond_to do |format|
         format.html
      end
    end
</code></pre>

<p>Limiting admin abilities to their own companies could be done with:</p>

<pre><code>@data = @current_user.company.data.find(params[:id])
</code></pre>

<p>This prevents them from editing anything outside their company because if they try it'll just return a record not found error.  Note that this could be cleaner, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>This railscast on subdomains will probably point you in the right direction: <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/123-subdomains" rel="nofollow">http://railscasts.com/episodes/123-subdomains</a> (I like using subdomains because it feels cleaner to me, but it's not necessary and you can still use most of the rest)</p>

<p>Everyone writes bugs. Part of your job as a programmer is how you deal with those bugs. I would try outlining the situation, fixing the bug, and resubmitting your code, just like you would at the job. After that, it depends on the company and how they make their hiring decisions. If it were me, however, and you showed initiative and took responsibility by following up on and fixing the bug, I don't know if it would be a deal breaker. In fact, it could turn a negative into a positive.</p>

<pre><code>var x = from u in Users
        select new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; {

<p>It returns a different result only when (x + 1) causes a loss of precision, that is, x is many orders of magnitude larger or smaller than one.</p>

<p>But I don't think this is <em>tricky</em> or <em>sleight of hand</em>, I think it's just plain <strong>wrong</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>cos(0) = 1 but f(1) = -pi/2
cos(pi/2) = 0 but f(0) = 0
cos(pi) = -1 but f(-1) = pi/2
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>f(x)</code> is Vincent's <code>arccos</code> implementation.  All of them are off by <code>pi/2</code>, a linear approximation that gets at least these three points correct would be</p>

<pre><code>g(x) = (1 - x) * pi / 2

<p>I don't see the details instantly, but think about what happens as x approaches 1 or -1 from either side, and consider roundoff error.</p>

<p>I'd still like to see an answer to this question, but I've worked around it by name-mangling the relationship accessors (e.g. '_otherentity' instead of 'otherentity') and then filtering on the name.  Works fine for my purposes.</p>

<p>Your question is a little unclear, but what I think you are asking is why your movie is not playing when the application launches before the user sees the controls and items in your XIB file. If this is correct, then this is the normal behavior as typically the application will launch and only then call the function you have (applicationDidFinishLaunching). There is no guarantee that you will get that function called before the controls have loaded and are viewable on the screen all the time.</p>

<p>It is bad form to start you application with a movie, but if you want to then you have to deal with the fact that there will potentially be a default image or even your controls that you put in your XIB file. </p>

<p>One way to start with a movie, is that you must hide or delete everything in the XIB file so the screen will appear blank when the application loads. Then, when you application calls the applicationDidFinishLaunching function the user will not have seen your application and the first thing they will see is the movie. When the movie is finished playing, you will need to have a notification listener instruct your application to show the controls for your application or switch to another XIB file that has the app controls within it.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. </p>

<p>I'm not sure if I'm reading your question right, but you can <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/" rel="nofollow">load JSON with jQuery</a>, instead of a script.</p>

<p>If then, the array is one of usernames, you can just use <code>response.hasOwnProperty(username)</code> or similar to check if it's in the JSON object you got back</p>

<p>Also, in php use <code>json_encode</code></p>

<li>Is there an already made plugin that I can connect to by implementing some api?</li>
<li>May I script this with eclipse monkey?</li>

<p>I'm doing research for making a chat based app for the iPhone (it's not really text chat in the regular sense, but the principles are the same). </p>

<p>Maximum 6 people can be logged into the same chat room at any one time, and the most basic question is how to efficiently check for new messages? </p>

<p>Would I need to simply poll the server periodically? Or is there a way I could trigger an event on the phone from the server whenever there is some new content to pay attention to?</p>

<p>If having to poll all the time, I worry about the resulting lag as each participant will have to wait longer for others before they can post their own responses to others. And, potentially it might also be too much to handle for the server to respond to lots of requests all the time. It would also waste bandwidth, which is not free for the user...</p>

<p>Unfortunately I will not be able to set up a socket server for this app, it has to be based around a regular LAMP configuration.</p>

<p>maybe your compile is keeping its reference in a registry instead of the stack...there is some way mentioned I think in README.EXT to force an object to never be GC'ed, but...the question still remains as to why it's being collected early...</p>

<p>In my case I want to write an app which is totally symetrical (not client-server) with identical functionality at two PCs, one a 'standard' Windows or Linxu box and the other an Android slate.</p>

<p>Can I run the same program on both or do I nneed to wrap it in an Android package for persmissioons, etc? </p>

<p>The two PCs will communciate by TCP/IP, sort of peer-to-peer, but I suspect that as a generic question this might be of interest to many.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>This is my jsf code :-</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;h:commandButton id="cmdLogin" value="Login" actionListener="#{indexBean.login}"&gt;
                            &lt;f:ajax execute="@form" render="@all" /&gt;
                        &lt;/h:commandButton&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is my login method of indexBean :-</p>

<pre><code> public void login(){

                HttpServletResponse objHttpServletResponse = (HttpServletResponse)FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getResponse();
                objHttpServletResponse.sendRedirect("Restricted/Home.jsf");

    }
</code></pre>

<p>I get one alert in javascript <code>emptyResponse: An empty response was received from the server.  Check server error logs.</code>. Why does this type of redirect not work?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :-</strong>
Interestingly, when i redirect from faces-config.xml, it works!</p>

<pre><code>&lt;faces-config version="2.0"
    xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" 
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-facesconfig_2_0.xsd"&gt;

    &lt;navigation-rule&gt;
        &lt;from-view-id&gt;/index.xhtml&lt;/from-view-id&gt;
        &lt;navigation-case&gt;
            &lt;from-outcome&gt;Home&lt;/from-outcome&gt;
            &lt;to-view-id&gt;/Restricted/Home.jsf&lt;/to-view-id&gt;
            &lt;redirect/&gt;
        &lt;/navigation-case&gt;
    &lt;/navigation-rule&gt;

&lt;/faces-config&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And obviously, i changed <code>actionListener</code> of commandbutton to <code>action</code> and changed return type of <code>login</code> to <code>String</code> and returned <code>home</code> from login method. Can anybody tell now, if this is the desired behaviour in JSF ? How come redirect  from <code>faces-config.xml</code> works and simple redirect in managedbean doesn't?</p>

<p>I already answered to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303696/mapping-lookup-tables">your question here</a> a few days ago about what's the right thing to do: <strong>map the relationships as proper relationships</strong>.</p>
^^
<p>That is poor use of a dictionary - you're only using it as a property bag, and create as many dictionaries as users.<br>
A better use of the language would be creating your own <code>User</code> class with these properties and use that:</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the query:</p>

<pre><code>var users = Users.Select(u =&gt; new User
            {
                Name = u.Name,
                LastName = u.LastName
            });
</code></pre>

<p>If you'll only use the collection whiting your method, another option is to create an anonymous class:</p>

<pre><code>var users = Users.Select(u =&gt; new { Name = u.Name, LastName = u.LastName });
</code></pre>

<p>I confess, I'm a greedy programmer. I'm easily excited by various languages/technologies/platform, and then want to learn and master them all. Well, it seems to be a good habit, but no one can learn everything, so I need to focus and concentrate on something most important.</p>

<p>Here's the list of things I would love to learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python (scripting)</li>
<li>F# (functional language)</li>
<li>Deeper C#/.NET </li>
<li>SQL Server (both development and administration)</li>
<li>WPF</li>
<li>High-availability DB, such as Hadoop/Cassandra</li>
<li>Software development philosophy </li>
<li>More advanced algorithm</li>
<li>Useful skills (unit testing...)</li>
</ul>

<p>etc...</p>

<p>OK, I'm not asking you which one I should choose and learn, but I believe that as a programmer, you would like to learn a lot of things, too. How did determine which one was important to you and how deep you should learn it? How did you determine which to learn first, which to learn deeper?...</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I cannot think of any technical reason why you would do this, but maybe it is done to make the class / interface relationships more explicit in the source code and Javadoc.</p>

<p>you can certainly use SSE registers, but compiler may do this for you anyways</p>
^^
<p>There are several ways to do it, I'll just mention one:</p>

<p>SSE4</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>PMINUD</code> and <code>PMAXUD</code> to separate the larger value in register #1, and the smaller value in register #2.</li>
<li>Subtract them.</li>
</ul>

<p>MMX/SSE2</p>

<ul>
<li>Flip the sign bit of the two values because the next instruction only accepts signed integer comparison.</li>
<li><code>PCMPGTD</code>. Use this result as a mask.</li>
<li>Compute the results of both <code>(a-b)</code> and <code>(b-a)</code></li>
<li>Use <code>POR ( PAND ( mask, a-b ), PANDN ( mask, b-a ) )</code> to select the correct value for the absolute difference.</li>
</ul>
^^
<p>Aim for learning at least one language/technology from each major "paradigm". As for what you decide to learn when, just go with whatever is most applicable to things you're actually trying to do. If nothing is applicable, go with whatever you find yourself thinking about the most.</p>

<p>Becoming a great programmer is a multiple-decade process. Becoming a competent programmer is an at-least-a-few-years process.</p>

<p>I aim for a new paradigm, or technology in an area I'm not very familiar with at least once a year. This is enough time to get more than a "tutorial-level" overview of the topic, allowing my newly gained knowledge to assist me when using other, more familiar, technologies. Sometimes the new stuff becomes the normal stuff as well.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to determine what to learn first by dipping your fingers in everything until you see what coats your hands and what runs off. Being a "greedy programmer" is not necessarily bad. Just don't be a greedy <em>and impatient</em> programmer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>What are the tricks and tips one should follow to search in google for exactly getting the relevant search. I have heard and used about google hacks but still having a lot of problem in searching the relevant data on google or any other search engine.</p>
^^
<p>Make sure you embed the font and that it is tracing out what the textfield is saying.</p>
^^
<p>I wouldn't necessarily say that UTF-16 is harmful.  It's not elegant, but it serves its purpose of backwards compatibility with UCS-2, just like GB18030 does with GB2312, and UTF-8 does with ASCII.</p>

<p>But making a fundamental change to the structure of Unicode in midstream, after Microsoft and Sun had built huge APIs around 16-bit characters, was harmful.  The failure to spread awareness of the change was <em>more</em> harmful.</p>
^^
<p><code>%$hash_ref = ();</code> makes more sense than undef-ing the hash. Undef-ing the hash says that you're done with the hash. Assigning an empty list says you just want an empty hash. </p>
^^
<p>Try this (assumes 2nd complements, which is OK judgning by the fact that you're asking for SSE):</p>

<pre><code>int d = a-b;
int ad = ((d &gt;&gt; 30) | 1) * d;
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation: sign-bit (bit 31) gets propagated down to 1st bit. the | 1 part ensures that the multiplier is either 1 or -1. Multiplications are fast on modern CPUs.</p>
^^
<p>I'm trying to get into making Facebook apps but I'm having trouble getting authorization working in a redirect scheme inside the canvas.</p>

<p>Using the javascript api, I got it working pretty easily in a popup scheme:</p>

<pre><code>$("#loginButton").click(function(e) {
    FB.login(function(response) {
        if (response.perms) {
            perms();
        }
}, {perms : 'publish_stream'});
</code></pre>

<p>But the popup should be an unnecessary extra click, because every other application I see requests the authorization before even showing you the landing page.  Like this:</p>

<p>i.imgur.com/yBGzL.png</p>

<p>I figure they're simply using a redirect scheme.  So I spent the entire day trying the different ways I could find:</p>

<pre><code>header("Location: https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=" . $gAppId . "&amp;redirect_uri=" . urlencode($gUrl) . "&amp;perms=publish_stream");

header("Location: http://www.facebook.com/login.php?v=1.0&amp;api_key=" . $gApiKey . "&amp;next=" . urlencode($gUrl) . "&amp;canvas=");

header("Location: http://www.facebook.com/connect/uiserver.php?app_id=" . $gAppId . "&amp;next=" . urlencode($gUrl) . "&amp;return_session=0&amp;fbconnect=0&amp;canvas=1&amp;legacy_return=1&amp;method=permissions.request");
</code></pre>

<p>But all of them, instead of showing the authorization request stuff, show a link like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/bLwPQ.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/bLwPQ.png</a></p>

<p>Hilariously, if I open the iframe's address in a new tab, I get the authorization request like I wanted.  But I want it to display immediately, without an extra click, like every other app.</p>

<p>Here's an example of an app that is doing authorization and requesting permissions all in one go, in redirect form, before even displaying the landing page:</p>

<p>www.facebook.com/send.fortune.cookies</p>

<p>How are they doing it?</p>

<p>Here is what was going on in my code. I have a class B which contains a method retuning the fetched result R whose type is NSManagedObject to my current class A. And I assign the R to the the property pR in A. After a while another method in A tried to update the object MO and persistent it in database. However pA became nil at that time. I needed to retain the R when it was assigned to pR. I declared pR to be (nonatomic, retain) and synthesized it. Does the fetched result returned from B will be released automatically? </p>

<p>No worry, you're not working at low enough levels to damage any of your hardware (on any semi-sane operating system, at least -- but I don't know any that's crazy enough to let application SW working at such a reasonable abstraction level to damage a monitor;-).</p>
^^
<p>I would say consider where you want your career path to go as one way to decide. That always helps me decide which languages to focus more of my energy on. I wouldn't let current work loads drive what you focus on. If you did you could end up doing the same thing for 5-10 years and realize that you missed a lot of things that could have contributed a lot to your growth.</p>

<p>Also I always tend to think patterns and disciplines are a much better use of your time than particular languages. Languages come and go. But a good design pattern can live on through nearly any language.</p>

<p>That's my thoughts!</p>

<p>hey all,</p>

<p>so i've scrapped all the crappy tutorials that have never worked for one reason or another, and decided to roll out my own registration/login feature on my own, and to my surprise it actually works!</p>

<p>But what i don't get is how the logic behind keeping somebody logged in works! Like, once they've logged in, do i just $_POST their data to whatever other page they visit and once they're on the new page $_REQUEST that post data from the url and display a message like: "yeah, you're still logged in"?</p>

<p>i'm a bit confused atm, so I hope this question doesn't confuse you too.</p>

<p>What is the story with the VC debug CRT?  where is it supposed to come from?</p>

<p>reading about this on the internet has been very confusing,  I feel that everyone is hacking around, copying bits to C:\windows\system32, etc.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>I have a PHP application, which has a delete function on one of the pages. I am allowing user to delete a tag from their profile, by clicking on the tag. Once the user clicks the tag, the content area in the HTML which previous displayed the tags, gets updated with the new set of tags.</p>

<p>Now the problem is, from the list of tags,the first time user clicks a tag, it is deleted.If the user now clicks another tag(from the refreshed area), nothing happens.</p>

<pre><code> $("a.single_tag").click(function(){
   the_id = $(this).attr('id');
     $.ajax({
         type: "POST",
         data: "data="+the_id,
         url: "&lt;?php echo site_url('user/deletetag/');?&gt;/",
         success: function(msg)
         {
           $("#current_tags").fadeIn("slow");
           $("#current_tags").html(msg);

         }
    });

<p>I want to style my <code>&lt;BR&gt;</code> elements to have margins more like <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> elements. How can I do that?</p>

<p>To link an executable with a library that resides in a standard location, one can do the following in a CmakeLists.txt file:</p>

<pre><code>create_executable(generate_mesh generate_mesh.cpp)
target_link_libraries(generate_mesh OpenMeshCore)
</code></pre>

<p>This would work if the library, that is being linked against, was placed in </p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/lib/libOpenMeshCore.dylib
</code></pre>

<p>However, in this case the library resides under</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/lib/OpenMesh/libOpenMeshCore.dylib
</code></pre>

<p>How can I specify that target_link_libraries should really link against a library placed in a sibdirectory? I wonder there is some useful option to target_link_libraries that would specify that the library is in a subdirectory in a standandard location, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>target_link_libraries(generate_mesh OpenMesh/OpenMeshCore)
</code></pre>

<p>If that is not possible, is there a way to use find_library to search <code>/usr/local/lib</code> recursively, including its sub-directories, for the given library file? </p>
^^
<p>Once they have logged in you generally have two options. Store their details or an authentication token (something that will help the PHP on the server know who is who) in a <a href="http://au.php.net/manual/en/book.session.php" rel="nofollow">session</a> or store it in a <a href="http://au2.php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php" rel="nofollow">cookie</a>. Both have their perks, but you will need to choose the one that works for you.</p>

<p>If you store data in a session, the user cannot access what you have stored, only your code can. This is helpful if you want to store say, their id or username. You can trust that it would always be their id and username, because they cannot modify it.</p>

<p>With cookies, the user can access and modify them because they are stored on their local machines. Because of this, you need to be a bit more sneaky and hash the users details, then verify who it is with some server-side logic. It's a little more complex.</p>

<p>A session implementation might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>session_start(); //Make sure you call this at the top of EVERY page
if($passwordsMatch){
    $_SESSION['user'] = $_POST['username'];
}
//Now we have access to $_SESSION['user'] on every page.
</code></pre>

<p>On another unrelated page:</p>

<pre><code>session_start();
print "Welcome, ".$_SESSION['user'];
</code></pre>
^^
<p>Perhaps you want <code>SUM</code> instead of <code>COUNT</code>?</p>

<p>If you're returning value 0 or 1 from your <code>IIF</code>, you're actually just counting how many values are being returned, no matter the numeric value within.</p>

<p>Change the Bs and Non-Bs to <code>SUM</code>, and you'll get the results you're looking for.</p>
^^
<p>How about...</p>

<pre><code>def nindex(mystr, substr, n=0, index=0):
    for _ in xrange(n+1):
        index = mystr.index(substr, index) + 1
    return index - 1
</code></pre>

<p>Obs: as <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.index" rel="nofollow"><code>str.index()</code></a> does, <code>nindex()</code> raises <code>ValueError</code> when the substr is not found.</p>

<p>Each time you create a window with <code>glutCreateWindow</code> it returns the window ID of the new window.  You can store this in a variable and use this to access the window later via <code>glutSetWindow</code>.</p>

<p>Also note that you would normally set the display function for a window just after creating it.</p>
^^
<p>Easiest way is to "keep users logged in" is to use PHP sessions. When you run session_start();, PHP sets cookie with SESSION_ID in users browser so it can identify this user. After that, you can set any data in $_SESSION array which will be saved in session between page requests.</p>

<p>You can (maybe in  2009 you couldn't) get the best of both worlds by using the <code>d:DataContext</code> attribute. You don't need any of that <a href="http://silverlightfeeds.com/post/1841/Simple_ViewModel_Locator_for_MVVM_The_Patients_Have_Left_the_Asylum.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>ViewModelLocator</code> craziness</a> if you're not ready for that yet :-)</p>

<p><code>d:DataContext="{d:DesignInstance IsDesignTimeCreatable=True, Type=vm:CustomerInsightViewModel}"</code></p>

<p>In your xaml codebehind :</p>

<pre><code>    public CustomerInsightUserControl()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        if (!DesignerProperties.IsInDesignTool)
        {
            DataContext = new CustomerInsightViewModel();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your ViewModel:</p>

<pre><code>    public CustomerInsightViewModel()
    {
        if (IsInDesignMode)
        {
            // Create design time data
            Customer = new Customer() {
                FirstName=... 
            }
        }
        else {
            // Create datacontext and load customers
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Don't miss the <code>IsDesignTimeCreatable=True</code> or else Blend won't instantiate your class</p>
^^
<p>Like this:</p>

<pre><code>br {
    margin-bottom: 1em;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have been pulling my hair out over the past few days with a div in that does not stretch across the entire width of the screen like it should.  Works fine in Firefox, but in IE (IE8 to be specific) it will not render correctly unless it is in Compatibility Mode.  <strong>If the page renders correctly in Compatibility Mode there has to be some hack or workaround that will also make it render correctly when not in Compatibility Mode.</strong></p>

<p>This also brings up a last resort question for me, <strong>how do I force a page to load in Compatibility Mode without user intervention?</strong></p>

<p><strong>I would like to avoid using Compatibility Mode though because it breaks my JavaScript</strong>, so I will have to modify my JavaScript if Compatibility Mode is used.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>There is no need for separate table for each user. But there could be some kind of optimizations involved with database.</p>

<p>user actually represents row of single table. In relation to user there could be other tables for specific purpose. Suppose "Comments" table contains comments by user, and this table can have multiple comments from user.Then this user table has one to many relationship with comments table.</p>

<p>Some of the optimizations I see here are Creating Views (Materialized Views in certin cases),Column Indexing based on query's used, Even Partitioning of Tables based on Dates/user or some other related criteria to application. </p>

<p>I've never experienced any issues with s3 caching or anything like that.  More than likely, I'd still consider this a local cache issue as the caching could be taking place in multiple places.  To confirm, I'd recommend viewing the actual files in your amazon bucket and seeing what you get after an update (I think amazon has this built into their s3 account site now, otherwise I've had good luck with cloudberry <a href="http://cloudberrylab.com/" rel="nofollow">http://cloudberrylab.com/</a>).  Alternatively, you could just try accessing it from a different computer after you've updated the file.</p>

<p>My problem is something that should be so simple it is mind boggling.  When I change the look (in PhotoShop) of an image file that is being stored in my app bundle.  My method for replacing the old image in the bundle with the new one is this:</p>

<p>1) remove the old image from the app bundle (choosing to also move to trash)
2) drag the new image into my file hierarchy in xcode (choosing to copy to app directory)</p>

<p>when I do this, the app cannot find the image no matter what I do.  The new images have the same name as the old images but none of the image loading methods (imageNamed, imageWithContentsOfFile, nibs) work.  (Although I believe nibs also load with imageNamed, i'm not sure).</p>

<p>Is there something that I am missing here?  I feel like it should be a relatively simple process but I am having all kinds of trouble.  I also make sure to delete the app off of the target device and clean all targets before rebuilding and running after changing the image files just in case.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<pre><code>IplImage *image;

<p>I want to know what I have written is correct or else I want to know how to write the correct one (in two lines).</p>

<p>The easiest imo is to use a session.
Basically this is PHP automatically setting a cookie (or adding a piece to the url, depending your configuration) on the user system and automatically loading it on each pageview. You can then add data to the session and as long as the cookie didn't expire (or was deleted) and/or you don't destroy the session, you will have that data at your disposal on each pageview the user does.</p>

<p>Take a look here for a small intro to sessions: <a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/php/article.php/3472581/PHP-Tutorial-Sessions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/php/article.php/3472581/PHP-Tutorial-Sessions.htm</a></p>

<p>You can specify any style to almost any element using CSS.</p>

<p>Default margin for P element is 1em 0; So, your CSS code should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>br { 
    margin: 1em 0; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to see default or current style properties for any element, you can use Firefox with Firebug or Chome/Safari/Opera Developer Tools. </p>
^^
<p>Instead of using <a href="http://api.jquery.com/click/" rel="nofollow"><code>.click()</code></a> for this, you want <a href="http://api.jquery.com/live/" rel="nofollow"><code>.live('click', func)</code></a>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$("a.single_tag").live('click', function() {
</code></pre>

<p>When you use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/click/" rel="nofollow"><code>.click()</code></a> you're binding a <code>click</code> handler <em>to those elements</em>, but when the content gets replaced, new elements with no handlers are there.  With <a href="http://api.jquery.com/live/" rel="nofollow"><code>.live()</code></a> it listens for the <code>click</code> event when it bubbles to <code>document</code> and executes...whether the element was there when the page loaded or added later, it won't matter...fixing your issue :)</p>
^^
<p>It is correct. Why didn't you just try it?</p>
^^
<p>Perfectly correct. But if you don't have a very good reason to do it that way, I'd suggest leaving it as a single line that both declares and initializes it. It's more obvious, and you're less likely to ever miss initializing a pointer that way.</p>
^^
<p>You need to throw that chunk of binding code in a function, and call it in the success callback, or only update the HTML of the updated tags (that is, return an id to delete, or a block of html to append, instead of redisplaying the whole block).</p>

<p>When you update the content, the <code>.click</code> binding does not exist on the new <code>a</code> tags.</p>

<p>Edit: @Nick Craver's solution is much better.</p>

<p>Kernel is the core code component of the operating system. It is used to interact with the hardware and provides an interface for application software. Read wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28computing%29" rel="nofollow">here</a> for detailed info.</p>

<p>Details vary from platform to platform, but in general the following steps
represent the boot process. </p>

<ul>
<li>When the computer starts, the BIOS
performs Power-On-Self-Test (POST)
and initial device discovery and
initialization, since the OS’ boot
process may rely on access to disks,
screens, keyboards, etc.</li>
<li>Next, the first sector of the boot
disk, the MBR (Master Boot Record) is
read into a fixed memory location and
executed. This sector contains a
small (512-byte) program that loads a
standalone program called boot from
the boot device, usually an IDE or
SCSI disk.</li>
<li>The boot program first copies itself 
to a fixed high memory address to<br>
free up low memory for the operating 
system. Once moved, boot reads the root
directory of the boot device.</li>
<li><p>To do this, it must understand the
file system and directory format,
which is the case with some
bootloaders such as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/" rel="nofollow">GRUB
BootloaderGRandUnified</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Other popular bootloaders, such as
Intel’s LILO, do not rely on any
specific filesystem. Instead, they
need a block map, and low-level
addresses, which describe physical
sectors, heads, and cylinders, to
find the relevant sectors to be
loaded.</p></li>
<li>Then it reads in the operating system
kernel and jumps to it. At this
point, boot has finished its job and
the kernel is running.</li>
</ul>
^^
<p>This is because new html tags that you just  received from the server, did not have your "delete" function bound to them on click.</p>

<p>I would suggest using the IE Developer Toolbar that comes installed in IE8 by default. It should help you troubleshoot your issue.</p>

<p>I want to implement a network level AdBlock/NoScript-like tool for Chromium, but Chromium Extension API can not do much about controlling raw request data.</p>

<p>So here is the idea:</p>

<ol>
<li>Capture all HTTP queries, and cancel one if URL or MIME matches.</li>
<li>Hand craft packets, like insert a header to an HTTP query.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can this be implemented by running a thirdparty client making <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/inter-process-communication" rel="nofollow">IPC calls</a> to Chromium? A snippet of sample code would be awesome!</p>

<p>Microsoft don't want you to put the Debug CRT DLL on end user machines so they don't provide an installer for it.</p>

<p>Quote from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa985618%28VS.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">the VC2005 doc on MSDN</a> Which I assume still applies to 2008 (emphasis is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Debug versions of an application are
  not redistributable and <strong>none of the
  debug versions of the various Visual
  C++ dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) are
  redistributable</strong>. Debug versions of an
  application and Visual C++ libraries
  can only be deployed to another
  computer internal to your development
  site for the sole purpose of debugging
  and testing your application on a
  computer that does not have Visual C++
  2005 installed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need to test a debug build of you application on another machines you still can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy the DLL and manifest from <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\redist\Debug_NonRedist</code> into your application directory</li>
<li>Include the Microsoft_VC90_DebugCRT_x86.msm merge module as part of your own installer.</li>

<p>The two queries are equivalent, and should produce identical plans.  It's a misconception that CTEs are compiled only once, providing a performance benefit.  Non-recursive CTEs are just syntactic sugar for derived tables/inline views (IMO mistakenly referred to as subqueries).</p>

<p>Secondly, JOINs vs IN/EXISTS can produce different results.  JOINs risk duplicated data, if there's two or more supporting records.  EXISTS is best used if there are duplicate criteria, because it returns true on the first encounter of the criteria - making it potentially faster than IN or JOIN.  There's no data duplication risk when using EXISTS or IN.</p>

<p>I read a few tutorials on getting memcached set up with Rails (2.3.5), and I'm a bit lost. </p>

<p>Here's what I need to cache:
I have user-specific settings that are stored in the db. The settings are queried in the ApplicationController meaning that a query is running per-request. </p>

<p>I understand that Rails has built-in support for SQL cacheing, however the cacheing only lasts for the duration of an Action. </p>

<p>I want an easy way to persist the settings (which are also ActiveRecord models) for an arbitrary amount of time. Bonus points if I can also easily reset the cache anytime a setting changes.</p>

<p>Well you cannot run an independent java application on Android. Android applications are compiled to dalvik bytecode and really are just written in java but not run on the java vm (Android does not have a java vm). However you can create a jar library that can be consumed by both a desktop and android application and that should provide reuse of platform independent code.</p>

<p>Hi all,
I have a service that starts and binds correctly when it's first called, but successive bindings to that same service fail when called by other activities.</p>

<p>The code:</p>

<pre><code>activity.startService(new Intent().setClass(activity, ServerListenerService.class));        

xmppServiceConnection = new ServiceConnection() {
        public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName name) {
            ServerActivityConnection.this.xmppService = null;
        }

        public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName name, IBinder binder) {
            //set everything up
        }
    };

activity.bindService(new Intent().setClass(activity, ServerListenerService.class), xmppServiceConnection, Activity.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);
</code></pre>

<p>The second time around, after the call to <code>activity.bindService</code>, the serviceconnection's <code>onServiceConnected</code> method never gets called. I use a connection class that does the binding, so the method is the same for both activities. The service is also correctly added the manifest file.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Many Thanks</p>

<p>Not having the keys stored in the source code actually is actually bad a practice in the accoding to the most agile setup (<a href="http://www.eishay.com/2010/07/continuous-deployment-at-kaching.html" rel="nofollow">continuous deployment</a>).</p>

<p>But, by what you say, you want to have two groups: those who can make the code, and those who can deploy it. Those who can deploy it have access to the keys, and, in the most secure setting, must NOT use the code of the application. You can make the oauth still work by having those who code autenticate to a system that proxies all the authorization part, and authenticates de application. Such keys (app -> auth middle man) can be in repository, as they are internal.</p>

<p>Any other setup: authentication library created by those who can deploy, encrypted keys, anything else can be broken by those who make the code. If you don't trust them enough to have access to the keys, you probably don't trust them enough not to try to <em>jailbreak</em> the keys.</p>

<p>The resulting deployment scheme is much more complicated, and, therefore much more prone to erros. But it is, otherwise, more secure. You still have to trust someone, like those who install the operating system, the proxy's system middleware, those who maintain the proxy's machine(s), those who can long on it, and so on. If the groupo of people with access to the keys is small enough, and you trust them, then you've gained security. Otherwise, you lost security, ability to respond to change, and wasted a lot of people's time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all authorization schemes require you to trust someone. No way around it. This is valid for any application/framework/authorization scheme, not only sinatra, rails, oauth, java, rsa signatures, elliptic curves, and so on.</p>

The only difference between then and now (that I can remember) is that I've installed many of the <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/" rel="nofollow">OmegaHat packages</a> from source.</p>

<p>I was curious if anyone else was getting this error. To explore if the cause lies with my laptop, I have restarted and upgraded my OS as a basic step. What might be the problem? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I have an array of strings in C and an integer indicating how many strings are in the array.</p>

<pre><code>char *strarray[MAX];  
int strcount;
</code></pre>

<p>In this array, the highest index (where 10 is higher than 0) is the most recent item added and the lowest index is the most distant item added. <b>The order of items within the array matters.</b></p>

<p>I need a quick way to check the array for duplicates, <b>remove all but the highest index duplicate</b>, and collapse the array.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>strarray[0] = "Line 1"; 
strarray[1] = "Line 2"; 
strarray[2] = "Line 3"; 
strarray[3] = "Line 2"; 
strarray[4] = "Line 4";
</code></pre>

<p>would become:</p>

<pre><code>strarray[0] = "Line 1"; 
strarray[1] = "Line 3"; 
strarray[2] = "Line 2"; 
strarray[3] = "Line 4";
</code></pre>

<p>Index 1 of the original array was removed and indexes 2, 3, and 4 slid downwards to fill the gap.</p>

<p>I have one idea of how to do it. It is untested and I am currently attempting to code it but just from my faint understanding, I am sure this is a horrendous algorithm.</p>

<p>The algorithm presented below would be ran every time a new string is added to the strarray.</p>

<p>For the interest of showing that I am trying, I will include my proposed algorithm below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Search entire strarray for match to str</li>
<li>If no match, do nothing</li>
<li>If match found, put str in strarray</li>
<li>Now we have a strarray with a max of 1 duplicate entry</li>
<li>Add highest index strarray string to lowest index of temporary string array</li>
<li>Continue downwards into strarray and check each element</li>
<li>If duplicate found, skip it</li>
<li>If not, add it to the next highest index of the temporary string array</li>
<li>Reverse temporary string array and copy to strarray</li>
</ol>

<p>Once again, this is untested (I am currently implementing it now). I just hope someone out there will have a much better solution.</p>

<p>The order of items is important and the code must utilize the C language (not C++). The lowest index duplicates should be removed and the single highest index kept.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi. I'm a beginner with MyBatis.</p>

<p>I just want to know how to insert a collection of objects from an instance of a class. Say I have a class User related to a Note in one-to-many relationship. I just like to mention that I built my schema using JPA 2 annotations via Hibernate's hbm2ddl. I'll add the key JPA annotations I used in the sample code below.</p>

<p>Here's a sample:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class User {
    ...
    @OneToMany
    @JoinColumn(name="user")
    public List&lt;Note&gt; getNotes() {...}
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, everytime I insert something into User table I have to insert instances into the Note table if the list is not empty. Take note of the @JoinColumn in Note table which should have the id of the inserted User, which I have set to be autogenerated.</p>

<p>Has anyone got something like this working? Thanks.</p>
^^
<p>Hi, I'd like to pass some parameters to a stateless session bean. I'd like to do something like I do when I configure a Servlet initial parameters in the web.xml file. Thanks</p>
^^
<p>Pretty broken code you're using there as a starting point (e.g. look at that <code>global rootnode</code> where name <code>rootnode</code> is used <em>nowhere</em> -- clearly half-edited source, and badly at that).</p>

<p>Anyway, what form are you using "client-side" for the <code>POST</code>?  How does it set that <code>upfile</code> field?</p>

<p>Why aren't you using the normal <code>FieldStorage</code> approach, as documented in <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html#using-the-cgi-module" rel="nofollow">Python's docs</a>?  That way, you could use the <code>.file</code> attribute of the appropriate field to get a file-like object to read, or its <code>.value</code> attribute to read it all in memory and get it as a string, plus the <code>.filename</code> attribute of the field to know the uploaded file's name.  More detailed, though concise, docs on <code>FieldStorage</code>, are <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/stdlib/cgi.FieldStorage-class.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: now that the OP has edited the Q to clarify, I see the problem: <code>BaseHTTPServer</code> does <strong>not</strong> set the environment according to the CGI specs, so the <code>cgi</code> module isn't very usable with it.  Unfortunately the only simple approach to environment setting is to steal and hack a big piece of code from <code>CGIHTTPServer.py</code> (wasn't intented for reuse, whence the need for, sigh, copy and paste coding), e.g....:</p>

<pre><code>def populenv(self):

        if i &gt;= 0:
            rest, query = rest[:i], rest[i+1:]
        else:
            query = ''

        # dissect the part after the directory name into a script name &amp;
        # a possible additional path, to be stored in PATH_INFO.
        i = rest.find('/')
        if i &gt;= 0:
            script, rest = rest[:i], rest[i:]
        else:
            script, rest = rest, ''

<p>This could be substantially simplified further, but not without spending some time and energy on that task:-(.</p>

<p>With this <code>populenv</code> function at hand, we can recode:</p>

<pre><code>def do_POST(self):
    populen(self)
    form = cgi.FieldStorage(fp=self.rfile)
    upfilecontent = form['upfile'].value
    if upfilecontent:
        fout = open(os.path.join('tmp', form['upfile'].filename), 'wb')
        fout.write(upfilecontent)
        fout.close()
    self.do_GET()
</code></pre>

<p>...and live happily ever after;-).  (Of course, using any decent WSGI server, or even <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/wsgiref.html#module-wsgiref.simple_server" rel="nofollow">the demo one</a>, would be much easier, but this exercise <em>is</em> instructive about CGI and its internals;-).</p>

<p>i have a bunch of divs that are representing cards in a hand.  depending on how many are drawn, i want to be able to have them start to stack on top of each other so that the hand container div is only one row deep.  the card divs are also set up as draggables so this is kind of me trying to figure out a way to auto sort them.  would using jquerys position setters be the best way to go about this?</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm missing something, but I don't see any reason that you couldn't simply do:</p>

<p>I am looking for a sample in C to get the result date when input of number of days and a date is given .</p>

<p>inputs are <code>date_t end_date, int days=7</code> is given</p>

<p>I should get a <code>date_t start_date</code> which is 7 days before than <code>end_date</code> value</p>

<p>The problem is that server side redirection is only redirecting your inner app frame instead of redirecting the whole page, and Facebook doesn't like displaying their system dialogs inside frames.</p>

<p>You would need some client side redirection, probably something along those lines:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    &lt;?php 
        if($doRedirect) {
            echo 'top.location="http://redirect_url";';
        }
    ?&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>You shouldn't have more than one element with the same id in your document. Use a class. The <em>easiest</em> way for you to do what you want then would be to use <a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a> and write <code>$('#parentDiv1 ul.test')</code> to select your element. Other than jQuery, you would need to implement <code>getElementsByClassName</code> in javascript in IE because afaik it still doesn't support it natively.</p>

<p>Edit: Make sure there aren't any "name" attributes that have the same value as the target id, and also that the js variable you're setting has a different name than the target id.</p>
^^
<p>"While there are no limitations on the number of databases or users supported, it is limited to using one processor, 1 GB memory and 4 GB database files (10 GB database files from SQL Server Express 2008 R2)." It is not the size of the database files that is an insue but "1 GB memory". Try spitting the 600MB+ file but putting it in the stream. </p>

<p>You need to bind in Pre_Init.  The problem about loosing the selected value of the checkbox should go away, too.</p>

<p>According to the documentation, the "grammerLocation" property can take two types of values:</p>

<ul>
<li>A resource locator (for resources in jars, classpath)</li>
<li>A URL</li>
</ul>

<p>So on windows, in your case you can do:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;component name="jsgfGrammar" type="edu.cmu.sphinx.jsapi.JSGFGrammar"&gt;
    &lt;property name="dictionary" value="dictionary"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="grammarLocation" value="file:/C:/Users/Pradeep/Documents/NetBeansProjects/FYPApplication11/"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="grammarName" value="word"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="logMath" value="logMath"/&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;

<p>The typical efficient unique function is to: </p>

<ol>
<li>Sort the given array.</li>
<li>Verify that <em>consecutive</em> runs of the same item are setup so that only one remains.</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe you can use <code>qsort</code> in combination with <code>strcmp</code> to accomplish the first part; writing an efficient <code>remove</code> would be all on you though.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't have specific ideas here; this is kind of a grey area for me because I'm usually using C++, where this would be a simple:</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; src;
std::sort(src.begin(), src.end());
src.remove(std::unique(src.begin(), src.end()), src.end);
</code></pre>

<p>I know you can't use C++, but the implementation should essentially be the same.</p>

<p>Because you need to save the original order, you can have something like:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct
{
    int originalPosition;
    char * string;
} tempUniqueEntry;
</code></pre>

<p>Do your first sort with respect to <code>string</code>, remove unique sets of elements on the sorted set, then resort with respect to <code>originalPosition</code>. This way you still get O(n lg n) performance, yet you don't lose the original order.</p>

<p>EDIT2:
Simple C implementation example of <code>std::unique</code>:</p>

<pre><code>tempUniqueEntry* unique ( tempUniqueEntry * first, tempUniqueEntry * last )
{
  tempUniqueEntry *result=first;
  while (++first != last)
  {
    if (strcmp(result-&gt;string,first-&gt;string))
      *(++result)=*first;
  }
  return ++result;
}

<p>Hello,
I was wondering what, if it is possible, is the best way to render a partial using the new razor view engine. I understand this is something that wasn't finished completely by the time</p>

<p>Right now I am using RenderPage to render the user control:</p>

<pre><code>@RenderPage("~/Views/Shared/LocaleUserControl.cshtml",ViewData.Model)
</code></pre>

<p>The page calling RenderPage uses a layout (master) page with three sections defined: TitleContent, HeadContent and Maincontent. When I attempt to render my locale control from this page it appears that these sections are also required - they should only be required in the calling page and are present. I receive the following message, regardless of whether or not I include the sections in my partial view (obviously I dont want to include these sections but it seemed like an interesting debugging point...). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following sections have been
  defined but have not been rendered on
  the layout page
  '~/Views/Shared/LocaleUserControl.cshtml':
  TitleContent; HeadContent; MainContent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My partial view is as follows (adapted from the following <a href="http://www.schnieds.com/2010/01/aspnet-mvc-locale-user-control.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>):</p>

<pre><code>@inherits System.Web.Mvc.WebViewPage&lt;LocaleBaseModel&gt;
@using System.Web.UI;

&lt;p&gt;
     @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; Model.CountryName)
    &lt;br /&gt;
    @Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; Model.CountryName,null, string.Empty, new { @class = "text", accesskey="u"})
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; Model.StateProvince)
    &lt;br /&gt;
     @Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; Model.StateProvince, null, string.Empty, new { @class = "text", accesskey="t" })
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    $(function () {
        var countries = $("#CountryName");
        var statesprovinces = $("#StateProvince");
        countries.change(function () {
            statesprovinces.find('option').remove();
            var url = '@Url.Action("GetStatesProvinces", "Base")';
            $.getJSON(url, { countryId: countries.val() }, function (data) {
                $(data).each(function () {
                    $("&lt;option value=" + this.ID + "&gt;" + this.Name + "&lt;/option&gt;").appendTo(statesprovinces);
                });
            });
        });

<p>In UI Builder the Background color has an "Other" choice.
This brings up a color picker.
The color picker has an opacity setting.
If you set the Opacity of the COLOR to 0 it works, can't speak to performance.</p>

<p>This isn't exactly what you're trying to do, but do you already know about <code>&lt;fb:visible-to-connection&gt;</code>? For example:</p>

   &lt;!-- do something --&gt;

<p>I'm having a little trouble with losing my array order after using unset(). Here's the code first:</p>

<pre><code>$id = $_GET['id'];
for($i = 0; $i &lt; count($my_array); $i++)
{
    if($my_array[$i] == $id)
    {
        unset($my_array[$i]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Assume that $my_array has 4 items and $my_array[1] is equal to $id. After I unset that I try to run a foreach() on $my_array and I get and Undefined Offset: 1 error. When I run print_r($my_array), I get $my_array[0], $my_array[2], and $my_array[3].</p>

<p>I understand perfectly why that's happening, my question is, is there a way to re-index the array so that item 2 'drops' to item 1, and and the rest of the items respectively to the end of the array?</p>

<p>Something like reindex($my_array) would be sweet. I know I could run another for loop with a new array and transfer them manually, but a one step solution would be awesome. I just couldn't find anything anywhere.</p>

<p>Hey guys,  </p>

<p>This website <a href="http://www.annapogossova.com" rel="nofollow">annapogossova.com</a> is set up through wordpress. </p>

<p>As you can see each "gallery" is set up as a page, with an iFrame linking to the actual html gallery. </p>

<p>The problem is - Anna would like to call each item in the drop down menu - Gallery 1, Gallery 2, Gallery 3 etc.. </p>

<p>This would be horrendous to manage as each page would then be called Gallery 1, Gallery 2, Gallery 3 etc..  </p>

<p>What's the best way around this situation? </p>

<p>I'm running wordpress 3 </p>
^^
<p>Do you put your images in a custom sub-folder? If you just drag in images into the Xcode project tree, if you copy them, the images will be copied to the root of the project directory, instead of the "Images" or other folder you might have set up.</p>

<p>Note that you can right-click on the image in your bundle, select "Get Info..." and reset its location, if it has been moved or copied to a folder you didn't expect.</p>

<p>I'm somewhat new to both QT and Windows development in general (I develop on Linux at work and rarely do GUI programming).</p>

<p>Anyway, I downloaded ACE and built it with Visual Studio Express 2008 and have been able to use it in VS programs but I'm having trouble making it play nicely with QTCreator.</p>

<p>My .pro file in QTCreator includes these lines:</p>

<pre><code>INCLUDEPATH += C:\Progra~1\ACE\ACE_wrappers
win32:LIBS += C:\Progra~1\ACE\ACE_wrappers\lib\ACE.lib
</code></pre>

<p>(the file C:\Progra~1\ACE\ACE_wrappers\lib\ACE.lib definitely exists)</p>

<p>When I try to compile it finds the headers just fine but the linker bombs out with a bunch of 'undefined reference' errors like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>debug/main.o:main.cpp:(.rdata$_ZTV18ACE_Reactor_Notify[vtable
  for ACE_Reactor_Notify]+0x10):
  undefined reference to
  `ACE_Event_Handler::get_handle()
  const'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I missing something in my project configuration?  Or did I do something wrong when I built ACE?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any advice.  I'm sure it's a simple misconfiguration.</p>

<p>I'm trying to write a Cairo program to black-fill the entire image and then draw another rectangle inside of it a different color. Eventually, I'm going to make this a program that generates a .png of the current time that looks like a digital clock. For now, this is where I'm getting hung up.</p>

<p>Here's my code:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cairo.h&gt;

//on color: 0.6, 1.0, 0
//off color: 0.2, 0.4, 0

int prop_number_width;
int prop_number_height;

int prop_width;
int prop_height;
int prop_space_width;
int prop_space_height;

double width;
double height;

double w_unit;
double h_unit;

void draw_number(cairo_t* cr, int unit_width, int num);

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    /* proportional sizes:
     * the widths and heights of the diagram
     */
    prop_number_width = 5; //how many spaces the number takes up
    prop_number_height = 6;

    prop_space_width = 1; //extra width on each side
    prop_space_height = 1; //extra height on each side
    prop_width = 25 + (2 * prop_space_width); //width of diagram
    prop_height = 6 + (2 * prop_space_height); //height of diagram

    /* actual sizes:
     * the pixel value of different sizes
     */
    width = 200.0;
    height = 100.0;

    w_unit = width / prop_width;
    h_unit = height / prop_height;

    //begin cairo stuff
    cairo_surface_t* surface = cairo_image_surface_create(CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32, (int)width, (int)height);
    cairo_t* cr = cairo_create(surface);

    //black fill
    cairo_set_source_rgb(cr, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    cairo_rectangle(cr, 0.0, 0.0, width, height); //cr ref, x, y, width, height
    cairo_fill_preserve(cr);

    //draw numbers from left to right
    draw_number(cr, 0, 1);
    //draw_number(cr, 6, 3);
    //draw_number(cr, 14, 3);
    //draw_number(cr, 20, 7);

    //draw in colons

    cairo_destroy(cr);
    cairo_surface_write_to_png(surface, "test.png");
    cairo_surface_destroy(surface);

    //determine the box size that the number will be drawn in
    double box_x = w_unit * (prop_space_width + unit_width);
    double box_y = h_unit * prop_space_height;
    double box_width = w_unit * prop_number_width;
    double box_height = h_unit * prop_number_height;

    printf("{box_x: %lf box_y: %lf} {box_width: %lf box_height: %lf}\n", box_x, box_y, box_width, box_height);
    cairo_set_source_rgb(cr, 0.2, 0.4, 0);
    cairo_rectangle(cr, box_x, box_y, box_width, box_height);
    cairo_fill_preserve(cr);
}

<p>The problem is with this code it draws the rectangle to take up the whole image where from the printf's it should only take up a small part. Does anybody know how I can make this rectangle show up as the correct size?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I want to stylize only certain word from my dynamic div</p>

<p>say,</p>

&lt;p&gt;here you can get info about somnething. if you want more info about something then click here....&lt;/p&gt;

<p>I can't thank Fuu enough for posting this answer.  I had a very rough time tonight trying to convince Mercurial Eclipse that my repository password had changed.  It seems to ignore .hgrc once it has it's own value in the repository cache.</p>

<p>Using the method described above I was able to remove the repository URL's and that convinced Mercurial Eclipse to look in my .hgrc for the new password.</p>

<p>You can write a method (code for delete operation ) to shift array values around.</p>

<p>like if element at x is deleted method would look like :</p>

<pre><code>private void deleteElement(int del_idx){
    if(del_idx &lt;= org_arr.length ){
        org_arr[del_idx]=null;
        for(int i = del_idx;i &lt; (org_arr.length-1); i++){
            if(org_arr[i+1] != null){
                org_arr[i] = org_arr[i+1];
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But it will be more suitable to use ArrayList rather than array in your case.</p>
^^
<p>Call <a href="http://php.net/array_values" rel="nofollow"><code>array_values</code></a> to reindex the array.</p>

^^
<p>Can you control the input as it is going into the array? If so, just do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>int addToArray(const char * toadd, char * strarray[], int strcount)
{
    const int toaddlen = strlen(toadd);

    // Add new string to end.
    // Remember to add one for the \0 terminator.
    strarray[strcount] = malloc(sizeof(char) * (toaddlen + 1));
    strncpy(strarray[strcount], toadd, toaddlen + 1);

    // Search for a duplicate.
    // Note that we are cutting the new array short by one.
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; strcount; ++i)
    {
        if (strncmp(strarray[i], toaddlen + 1) == 0)
        {
            // Found duplicate.
            // Remove it and compact.
            // Note use of new array size here.  
            free(strarray[i]);
            for(int k = i + 1; k &lt; strcount + 1; ++k)
                strarray[i] = strarray[k];

            strarray[strcount] = null;
            return strcount;
        }
    }

    // No duplicate found.
    return (strcount + 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can always use the above function looping over the elements of an existing array, building a new array without duplicates.</p>

<p>PS: If you are doing this type of operation a lot, you should move away from an array as your storage structure, and used a linked list instead. They are much more efficient for removing elements from a location other than the end.</p>
^^
<p>I can recall facing a similar problem: that is, how to select a word without selecting any trailing space. I think that code like this C++</p>

<pre><code>textRange-&gt;StartOf(tomWord,tomMove,NULL);
textRange-&gt;MoveEnd(tomWord,1,NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>should give you the right selection, so that you can then test if the caret is in the selection.</p>

<p>I use FireFox as my main browser, especially when testing out my site, <a href="http://www.avoru.com" rel="nofollow">Avoru</a>. However, when checking to see if my code was working properly across other major browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari), I found that none of my custom javascript seemed to work. Although the functions and code were clear in the page source, using typeof returned an 'undefined' value for all my functions.</p>

<p>I'm at a loss.  I'm using JQuery 1.4.2 and JCrop 0.98.  Everything else works fine, but I cannot move a selection once created.  When I mouse over the selection and click, nothing happens.</p>

<p>I have the JQuery library, the JCrop library and the JCrop css file all included.  It's a pretty clean page without much else on it.  I don't know if I'm accidentally overriding something in my own javascript and css in such a way that it breaks JCrop, there's quite a bit of both.  But Firebugs isn't turning anything up.</p>

<p>The tutorials work fine with my browse and on my server, though they do use a different version of jquery.  However, when I replace the version they originally used with the version I use they continue to work just fine.  So it has to be something to do with my javascript or css.</p>

<p>I'm at a completely loss here, I'm looking at everything I can think of for where an issue might be, but I don't even know where to look.  Has anyone else ever run into this issue before?  What was the problem and how did you solve it?  Where should I look for an error or bad override?</p>

<p>Are you referring to accepting cookies from other sites? These are usually disabled in modern browsers, which only accept cookies from the site whose address is in address bar and not others.</p>

<p>The reason they were banned was they made trivial to track users between collaborating websites, although the advantage provided by this banning is dubious (there are equally effective methods available).</p>

<p>Note that a website can also define a cookie whose scope is larger than the current domain, as long as it doesn't ascend to a top-level domain. For instance <code>meta.stackoverflow.com</code> could define a cookie whose scope included <code>whatever.stackoverflow.com</code> and even <code>stackoverflow.com</code>, but not <code>example.com</code>.</p>

<p>The answer to your question is "no". Usually what these sites do is have one table for users where the key of the table is an integer id field, and the attributes are attributes of the user (e.g. name, screen name, password, etc). In SQLite, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>create table User (id integer, email string);
</code></pre>

<p>Then you have a couple of tables, say, blog_posts and comments. Each of these table contains blog posts and comments from all users. To identify a user, there is a "user_id" field which identifies a row in that table as belonging to a particular user. </p>

<pre><code>create table BlogPosts (id integer, description text, user_id integer);
create table Comments (id integer, description test, blogpost_id integer, user_id integer);
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax is similar for other databases. "user_id" ties a blog post to a user and a comment to  a user. blogpost_id ties a blog post to a user. i.e. You can associate each user with all of his questions and comments. </p>

<p>You can create one table per user, but then you have to have a mapping of which user connects to which database, and you need to always open new connections to databases for each user. </p>

<p>My workplace uses Hudson for its daily builds, with several build slaves (one Linux, one Windows, one Mac) checking out our full codebase from svn and building our app at midnight each day.  This all works fairly well.</p>

<p>There is an occasional problem that happens though... sometimes a developer will be working late, and will check in a change to svn just after midnight.  When this occurs, it's possible that some of the daily build slaves will do their 'svn checkout' before the svn commit is processed, while other build slaves will do it after the commit is processed.  When this happens, we end up with different revisions built on different platforms... e.g. the Mac build might a build of SVN revision 5555, while the Windows build ends up being a build of SVN revision 5556.  That's bad, since we want all of the daily builds for a given day to be based on the same codebase.</p>

<p>I suppose one way to avoid this is to forbid developers to commit to svn between 11:30PM and 12:30AM, but I'd prefer a more elegant solution that doesn't rely on the developers behavior.  Is there one?  In particular, if there is a way to tell hudson to check out the revision of the code that was current at midnight of the current day (e.g. "svn co -r{"the-current-date"}") instead of checking out HEAD, I think that might do the trick.</p>

<p>Is there a common/easy way to handle this problem?</p>

<p>I can't stop the stupid thing from firing off an event when hovering over the children of item.

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm currently building a website for a company, that will for the moment contain 3-5 static pages (i.e, just content). User registration may be added in time to come.</p>

<p>Now, I've been reading through the Liferay docs, forums and wiki, and I'm still pretty unclear on the approach to take in designing this website.</p>

<p>1) If I were to model my company Website as an organization in Liferay where I would have the public pages of the Website, what would be the purpose of the default guest page? (/web/gues/home)? Do I remove this and redirect the guest to my organization? If so, how do I do this?</p>

<p>2) Who is the creator of an organization in the real world? Is this site administrator? Or the person responsible for adding content? </p>

<p>3) Who is the creator of an organization in Liferay? Is this the administrator to Liferay (i.e the default Test user)? </p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>I have a WxPython app that, among other things, has a integrated file-browser.</p>

<p>I want to be able to create a system-default file context menu (e.g. what you get if you right-click on a file in windows explorer) when a user right clicks on one of the items within my application.</p>

<p>Note: I already know how to create my own context menu (e.g. wx.EVT_LIST_ITEM_RIGHT_CLICK), I want the <em>Windows</em> context menu.</p>

<p>To clarify, I do not want, or need to modify the existing system context menu, I want to be able to <strong>display</strong> it for a specific file within my application. </p>

<p>Basically, I know what was right clicked on, and where the mouse pointer is (if it's needed). I want to create the system context menu there, just like it works in windows explorer.</p>

<p>Hi</p>

<p>I'm very confused with dotnet framework installation. </p>

<p>Even though I've installed the latest version (4.0), some dotnet framework-based programs told me that I need to install version 1.1 or 2.0. </p>

<p>So, I'm curious to know whether I need to install every version of DotNet framework so that every kind of such program can run. Does it cause due to programmer's badly checks?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>It's not binding to the children. It's bubbling up to the parent.</p>

<p>Also, your syntax isn't correct. This:</p>

<pre><code>$("div.item", "div.items")...
</code></pre>

<p>is saying "find me all the divs with class item that are descendants of divs with class of items. But you have no such divs (with class items). You have a div with an ID of items.</p>

<p>Combining all this try:</p>

<pre><code>$("#items div").live("mouseover mouseout", function(event) {
  if ($(event.source).hasClass("itemChild")) {
    return false;
  } else if (event.type == "mouseover") {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Or, alternatively:</p>

<pre><code>$("#items &gt; div.item").live("mouseover mouseout", function(event) {
  if (!($this).is("div.item")) {
    return false;
  }
  ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, there are many ways to skin this cat but like I said in the first sentence, you have to understand that events bubble up until the handlers stop propagation, either directly (by calling <code>event.stopPropagation()</code> or by returning <code>false</code> from the event handler, which is equivalent to <code>event.stopPropagation(); event.preventDefault();</code>).</p>

<p>Also, if you're doing <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseout</code> you might as well just use the <code>hover()</code> event that does both of those:</p>

<pre><code>$("#items &gt; div.item").live("hover", function(event) {
  // mouseenter
}, function(event) {
  // mouseout
});
</code></pre>

<p>I want to change the values of column <strong>this</strong> in <strong>table_one</strong> where <strong>this</strong> = 1 and <strong>id</strong> value of that row exists anywhere in <strong>table_two</strong>'s column <strong>other_id</strong></p>

<p>So I'm using this query:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE table_one SET this='0' WHERE this='1' AND table_one.id IN (SELECT other_id FROM table_two);
</code></pre>

<p>The query took several hours without yet finishing, so I was wondering if there is a way to accomplish it faster.</p>

<p>Both <strong>table_one.id</strong> and <strong>table_two.other_id</strong> have unique values if that matters.</p>

<p><strong>table_one</strong> has 550k rows</p>

<p><strong>table_two</strong> has 30k rows</p>

<p>I have birth dates on my site in format <code>12.01.1980</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$person_date (string) = Day.Month.Year
</code></pre>

<p>Want to add an oldness of the person. Like "<strong>Currently 30 years</strong>" (2010 - 1980 = 30 years).</p>

<p>But makin the function just on years can't give the perfect result:</p>

<p>If person birth date is <code>12.12.1980</code> and current date is <code>01.01.2010</code> the person doesn't have 30 years old. It's a 29 years and one month.</p>

<p>There must be a calculation on targeting <strong>both year, month and day</strong> of birth with comparison of current date:</p>

<p>0) Parse the dates.</p>

<pre><code>Birth date (Day.Month.Year):
Day = $birth_day;
Month = $birth_month;
Year = $birth_year;

Current date (Day.Month.Year):
Day = $current_day;
Month = $current_month;
Year = $current_year;
</code></pre>

<p>1) year comparison, 2010 - 1980 = write "30" (let it be <code>$total_year</code> variable)</p>

<p>2) compare the months, if (birth date month is bigger > than current month (like 12 in birth and 01 current)) { do minus one year from <code>$total_year</code> variable (30 - 1 = 29) }. If do minus happened, finish the calculations at this point. Else go the next (3 step).</p>

<p>3) <code>else if (birth month &lt; current month) { $total_year = $total_year (30); }</code></p>

<p>4) <code>else if (birth month = current month) { $total_year = $total_year (30); }</code></p>

<p>and check the day (in this step):</p>

<pre><code> if(birth day = current day) { $total_year = $total_year; }
 else if (birth day &gt; current day) { $total_year = $total_year -1; }
 else if (birth day &lt; current day) { $total_year = $total_year; }
</code></pre>

<p>5) echo $total_year; </p>

<p>I should have looked at the API more carefully. I needed to do cairo_fill() instead of cairo_fill_preserve(). Apparently, the first call to cairo_fill_preserve() was keeping the original rectangle and always filling that one.</p>

<p>It really depends on what version of the framework that the application was designed to run on, there are a few versions of the framework and a few of the runtime.  Sometimes an application can be written for .NET 3.5 but has references to libraries that were written against .NET 1.1 in which case you would need both installed.</p>

<p>There is a fair breakdown of the Framework, Runtime and Language reference <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/688441/c-version-and-net-framework-version/688444#688444">In this Answer</a>.</p>

<p>After competing in and following this year's <a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html" rel="nofollow">Google Code Jam</a>  competition, I couldn't help but notice the incredible number of [successful] contestants that used C/C++ and Java. The distribution of languages used throughout the competition can be seen <a href="http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/languages/6" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>After programming in C/C++ for several years, I recently fell in love with Python for its readable/straightforward nature. More recently, I learned functional languages like OCaml, Scheme, and even logic languages like Prolog. These languages certainly have their merits and, in my opinion, can be applied more easily than C++ and Java for certain situations. For example, Scheme's use of call/cc simplifies backtracking (a tool required to answer several problems) and Prolog's logic specification, although inefficient due to its brute-force nature, can drastically simplify (and even automatically solve) certain problems that are difficult to wrap one's brain around.</p>

<p>It is clear that a competition contestant should use the tools that are best suited for the challenge. Even x86 assembly is Turing complete - that doesn't justify solving problems with it. In this case, <strong>why are the contestants that use less common languages like Scheme/Lisp, Prolog, and even Python significantly less successful than contestants that use C/C++ and Java?</strong> Worded differently, <strong>why don't successful contestants use languages that, although may be less mainstream, are arguably better tools for the job?</strong></p>

<p>There are several motivations for my question. Most importantly, I would like to become a better programmer - both in the practical aspect and the competition aspect. After being introduced to such beautiful paradigms like functional and logic programming, it is discouraging to see so many people discard them in favor of C/C++ and Java. It even makes me question my admiration for said paradigms, worrying that I cannot be successful as a Lisp/Scheme/Prolog programmer in a programming competition.</p>

<p>If you have python win32 installed, then look under the directory <code>&lt;PYTHON&gt;/lib/site-packages/win32comext/shell/demos/servers</code>.  This contains a file <code>context_menu.py</code> which has sample code for creating a shell extension.</p>

<p>Yes, it's always better to be as explicit as possible while writing production code. Eventhough technically it would not a difference to mention "implements Readable" but it might just help some lonely developer maintaing code at some unearthly hour one fine night. Instead of having him to understand where the methods got implemented from, by looking at AbstractInstant class in your example.</p>

<p>Has anyone ran into an issue with overriding onKeydown where the system kind of freezes for a second? I ran into this with a custom surfaceView, so I did a small test. I created a super simple activity with a counter that just updates a textview:</p>

<pre><code>int count = 0;

@Override
public void onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
    count++;
    // Output count to a textview control. 
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you try that out, and hold any key, you'll see the textview update, then nothing for a second, and it'll catch back up. </p>

<p>Thanks for any input. </p>

<p>how create makefiles in c++ and why it is used?</p>
^^
<p>I don't quite understand your proposed algorithm (I don't understand what it means to add a string to an index in step 5), but what I would do is:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned int i;
for (i = n; i &gt; 0; i--)
{
    unsigned int j;

    if (strarray[i - 1] == NULL)
    {
        continue;
    }

    for (j = i - 1; j &gt; 0; j--)
    {
        if (strcmp(strarray[i - 1], strarray[j - 1]) == 0)
        {
            strarray[j - 1] = NULL;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you just need to filter the null pointers out of your array (which I'll leave as an exercise).</p>

<p>A different approach would be to iterate backwards over the array and to insert each item into a (balanced) binary search tree as you go.  If the item is already in the binary search tree, flag the array item (such as setting the array element to <code>NULL</code>) and move on.  When you've processed the entire array, filter out the flagged elements as before.  This would have slightly more overhead and would consume more space, but its running time would be O(n log n) instead of O(n^2).</p>

<p>I were like you. Although Ruby is popular, they are very bad and inconsistent in such kinds of various versions. Firstly, I thought that the latest version is always the best, which holds the true for most languages. Later, in these days, due to the removal, re-structure and redesign of logic and underlying codes, the latest version is not always good for programmers who are used to writing codes in older version. See  python case (2.x vs 3.x).
So, for ruby, if you're holding a book that teaches you in ruby 1.8.x, then just relax and adhere to 1.8.x. Install 1.8.x version and Practice. Same for 1.9.x and other versions. Or else you'll end up with frustration like "why doesn't my code run?". </p>

<p>The most important thing is RubyGem. RubyGem is also stick to ruby version. Gems that run in 1.8.x are not usually compatible with 1.9.x. So, keep that in mind. Or else you're unhappy that you install this gem and you can't  call it - its objects. </p>

<p>Now, my practice is that I install every version. I exclude ruby path and its lib in PATH variable. When I want to switch between each version, I use BAT/bash file that set variable for each version like PATH=$PATH:/opt/ruby18 . </p>

<p>I've also asked many  questions about this in many forums. As you know, the life and true aspect of programming is to (re)use libraries and objects. If certain libraries don't work with a certain version of ruby, then you have to switch to others. This is also my bad feeling about ruby. They really should have backward compatibility. </p>

<p>Maybe others can solve this problem smarter than me. But it really messed up with my programming life. </p>

<p>As I understand it, .NET 3.5 includes versions 2.0 and 3.0 as it builds upon them. However, .NET 4.0 has no dependencies on previous versions and therefore they were removed in order to reduce the installation size, which was a common deployment complaint.</p>

<p>If the version of the .NET Framework that the program was built against is not present on the computer, and it doesn't specify any supported versions in a configuration file, then the latest version of the .NET Framework will attempt to run it.</p>

<p>There are a large number of projects with major release milestones just around the corner. These include Ruby 1.9.2 (the 2nd RC is already out), Rails 3.0 (the RC is already out), and a number of other libraries and plugins. Please note that Rails 3 does not support Ruby 1.9.1, although it does support 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.</p>

<p>I would start out with Ruby 1.9.2-rc2 and Rails 3.0.0.rc. These are what will be the current version over the next few years, starting within the next few weeks. Previous versions of Ruby and Rails will be legacy.</p>

<p>Look for new editions of books coming out, having been updated for Ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3.0.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="http://docs.php.net/class.datetime" rel="nofollow">DateTime class</a> and its <a href="http://docs.php.net/datetime.diff" rel="nofollow">diff()</a> method.</p>

// $today = new DateTime('00:00:00'); - use this for the current date
$today = new DateTime('2010-08-01 00:00:00'); // for testing purposes

$diff = $today-&gt;diff($bday);

printf('%d years, %d month, %d days', $diff-&gt;y, $diff-&gt;m, $diff-&gt;d);

<p>Take your pick, the Rails book or the version that you specifically need to learn.
Once you decide on a book, install the versions of the language / gems as mentioned in the book. e.g. Rails 1.2 and Rails 2.0 had pretty big differences and the tutorials wouldn't work.<br>
If you're learning Rails, pick a well known book, install the specific gems. Once you're done with the book, you'd be in a better position to look at the differences and migrate to higher versions with less hassle.</p>

<pre><code>gem list rails --remote

gem install [gemname] --version [version]

<p>VolkerK's answer is the only practice. You'll never need to parse date from strings or string to data conversion. Adhere to calling new DateTime object. Please keep PHP Manual with you. It's really like a tutorial rather than tedious language internal.</p>

<p>I think the version with the CountDownLatch is probably the best solution. "Java Concurrency in Practice" (Brian Goetz) actually talks about this (I think he calls it the value latch). It's essentially a one-time synchronization mechanism on a value being set.</p>

<p>Although it is possible to implement such a value latch with the wait()-notifyAll() mechanism, using the CountDownLatch yields a simpler implementation.</p>

<p>The CountDownLatch await()-countDown() methods provide a proper happens-before relationship.</p>

<p>Hi all, </p>

<p>Which is better practice?  </p>

<pre><code>.listing { some attributes:some values;}
</code></pre>

<p>applied to multiple locations (e.g. search results, category listing)</p>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>.search-list,
.category-list,
.other-list { some attributes:some values;}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me that the second option provides 
more flexibility for future changes to style without changing (x)html and also easier maintenance due to knowing exactly where the rules are applied, but needs more bandwidth to download and browser processing power to parse.  </p>

<p>Interested in your thoughts.</p>

<p>Thanks,

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I have an xslt script that transforms an xml file to another xml file.
The problem I'm having is that the resulting xml file does not end with a newline like a well behaved linux file.</p>

<p>I'm using <code>&lt;xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes"/&gt;</code> for the code to be nicely idented.</p>

<p>Is there a way to tell xslt that this is Linux mode, and it should add a newline at the end of the output?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Anna</p>

<p>So the problem was actually in the fact that I wasn't specifying the <code>:require =&gt; 'aws/s3'</code> after declaring the gem in the Gemfile. It's working fine now. Strange though is that now I've switched to the right_aws gem and the problem (which used to affect that gem as well) seems to have gone away even though you don't have to specify the :require with right_aws. Anyone have ideas on that?</p>

<p>Most specifically to your question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The .NET Framework version 3.5 builds upon versions 2.0 and 3.0 and their service packs. The .NET Framework version 3.5 Service Pack 1 (SP1) updates version 3.5 assemblies and includes new servicing updates for versions 2.0 and 3.0.</p>

<p>I'm using Apache, Python (fastcgi), mod_rewrite.</p>

<p>I want </p>

<pre><code>http://foo/bar
</code></pre>

<p>to redirect internally to</p>

<pre><code>http://main.py?q=foo/bar
</code></pre>

<p>Now my .htacess file contains</p>

<pre><code>Options +ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .py
DirectoryIndex main.py

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f 
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d 
RewriteRule (.*) main.py?q=$1
</code></pre>

<p>Normally works fine. Redirects to main.py with the query-string q=foo/bar
But if I have a script named foo.py it instead directs to foo.py instead of main.py.</p>

<p>I tried removing the RewriteConds and have the RewriteRule alone as a catch-all. </p>

<p>Then it always redirects to main.py ok, but the query-string passed to my script is q=main.py where it should be q=foo/bar</p>

<p>Now there's various kludges I could try involving restructuring my code, file layout etc, but I'd like figure out what's going on before it causes more problems down the track.</p>

<p>So I want to either a) stop it thinking that foo means foo.py or b) make it skip the existing file checks completely and pass on the correct query-string.</p>

<p>If I understand your question correctly, the sample below will do it.  Since <em>Any</em> takes a delegate you can define an arbitrary matching comparison between the two elements of the list.  If you need all elements to match, use <em>All</em> in place of <em>Any</em>.</p>

<pre><code>[Test]
public void StackOverflow()
{
  var digits = new int[] {1, 2, 4, 9};
  var strings = new string[] {"1", "4", "5", "7"};

  var matches = strings.Where(s =&gt; digits.Any(d =&gt; d.ToString() == s)).ToList();

  // Prints
  // 1
  // 4

  matches.ForEach(x =&gt; System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(x));
}

<p>I've not used Visual Studio with Qt, and I tend to very rarely use QtCreator, but usually these errors mean that moc has failed and you need to re-run qmake. The odd thing is that QtCreator isn't doing this for you. Have you been able to compile any other Qt programs?</p>

<p>Since you're more comfortable with the GNU toolchain, why not try using mingw? <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/DOC_ROOT/ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#mingw" rel="nofollow">Instructions for ACE</a> are fairly straightforward, <del>and you won't need to compile Qt yourself (which is a huge plus)</del> (Ok, as of Qt 4.6 Nokia are providing pre-built versions for VS 2008).</p>

<p>I faced similar situation. When instrument gathers data, the app seems to hang up. And this is natural. </p>
^^
<p>Take a look to AVFoundation framework , specially to avcapture avsession avinputdevice, etc. You can find some listings in the iPhone dev center forums: search "avcapture"
AVFoundation is the framework you want to use to record, modify raw frames, show them, an offcourse add some overlay</p>

<p>If you want to do only overlay then, UIImagePickerController should b enough.</p>
^^
<p>Yes, this is normal as Instruments is constantly monitoring the app's process, which causes the app to run considerably slower than normal.</p>

<p>I faced with a sample code in Java and it brought me a question.</p>

<p><strong>Java</strong> sample code is:</p>

<pre><code>...
public interface CLibrary extends Library {
    CLibrary INSTANCE = (CLibrary) Native.loadLibrary((Platform.isWindows() ? "msvcrt" : "c"), CLibrary.class);
    void printf(String format, Object... args);
}

public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    CLibrary.INSTANCE.printf("Hello, World\n");
}
</code></pre>

<p>But in <strong>C#</strong> we cannot write like that:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IMyInterface {
    static readonly int staticInt = 5;                          // compile error
    static readonly SomeClass staticInstance = new SomeClass(); // compile error
}
</code></pre>

<p>What is the difference between these two languages/frameworks?</p>

<p>What design policy permit java to have const fields in an interface or what prevents .NET from having that?</p>
^^
<p>Its Legal to do it, But there shouldn't be any difference. 
I don't even see any reason to do it.</p>

<p>A Makefile is a file with a batch of commands used to compile and link (yes, you can use it for other purposes outside of compilation), especially used where there are special compiler options required, or where a program requires the compilation of many files (sometimes thousands), where manual compilation is difficult. In the latter case, the Makefiles themselves are usually computer-generated.</p>

<p>Makefiles are usually called "Makefile" as that is one of the three names that <code>make</code> searches for. If you use another name, you will have to specify it manually to <code>make</code> or compilation will not occur.</p>

<p>Makefiles are not specific to C++; they can be used to compile programs in any language.</p>

<p>The basic structure of a Makefile:</p>

<pre>all: makeTarget2
    gcc -o /usr/local/bin/myprogram myprogram.c
makeTarget1:
    something else
    more commands
makeTarget2:
    something else
    more commands</pre>

<p>A Makefile always has the target labelled <code>all</code>, which is run when the user runs <code>make</code> with no make target. Words after the label, on the same line, are other make targets that are run before the body of that label is run (because it is depended on).</p>

<p>Commands follow labels on subsequent lines prefixed using tab characters ("U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION" only - no spaces!).</p>

<p>Other make targets, not called "all", continue in the same way. One will call these make targets, either by running <code>make makeTargetName</code>, or through dependency (e.g. <code>all</code> depends on <code>makeTarget2</code>).</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I'm trying to have different pictures on every one of my pages built on wordpress.</p>

<p>So I have the following in my index.php file, archive.php file, page.php file, etc:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="&lt;?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?&gt;/images/&lt;?php echo $toppic; ?&gt;" alt="page1" id="mainPageImg" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in my page.php file, I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    // TOP PICTURE DEFINITIONS
    if ( is_home() ) {
        $toppic == 'page1.png';
    }
    if ( is_page('articles') ) {
        $toppic == 'page2.png';
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How come this does not work? I tried it with one equal (=) sign...</p>

<p>EDIT: If I define $toppic at the top, for example, in the index.php file as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php $toppic = 'page1.png'; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then it works. So therefore, it must be something that has to do with the conditional if is_page/is_home statements. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks!

<p>The use of interfaces to hold constants is usually frowned on these days in Java too. (I'd say that storing <em>non-compile-time-constant</em> fields like your example is even more frowned upon.)</p>

<p>Fundamentally, it's at odd with the idea of an interface: a contract that the implementation will uphold. The implementation isn't going to provide the field, so what's it doing there?</p>

<p>I suspect the C# team decided that it was sufficiently at odds with the concept behind interfaces to not include it in the language. I don't know whether it's just a C# restriction or a CLR restriction too. For example, I know that the CLR allows interfaces to declare nested types, but C# doesn't currently allow this.</p>
^^
<p>Problem solved:</p>

<pre><code>* { margin: 0; padding: 0; position: relative; }
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>position: relative;</code> was overriding JCrop's need for absolute positioning.  Once removed, it worked beautifully.  I'd needed it for other stuff, but I just applied it on a more precise basis. </p>

<p>Took me forever to find it though, had to take both my javascript and css into one of their demo files and check each piece for conflict.  Pain in the butt.  </p>

<p>If you experience a similar problem, check to see if you have a similar conflict of positioning.</p>
^^
<p>Use context, as implemented using child selectors, (modified based on your comment below).  This makes it clear what attributes are part of a general list and what attributes are specific to a search-list.</p>

<pre><code>.list li { default attributes: default values }
#search-list li { attributes specific to search listings: some values; }

with markup

&lt;ul id="search-list" class="list"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;...
</code></pre>

<p>I've recently been working with some top designers.  They talk negatively about markup that has "div-itis" or "class-itis" (they would skip the list class above and style ul).  To counter this, they use ids and native tags like <em>li</em>, <em>h5</em>, etc within.  Since it's a PITA to clear default values, they define only a few defaults and use contextual selectors for the rest.  They use multiple class names when they need them.  They also tend to use compass or less because these environments allow contextual selectors and mix-ins.</p>

<p>I'm guessing from the diagrams that you are aligned to a * Unified Process approach.</p>

<p>IMHO:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Case - definitely - eliciting business and system level requirements is implementation agnostic</li>
<li>System Architecture - definitely - layers, processes, network, db and modules / packages.</li>
<li>Activity Diagrams - definitely - use this to describe process flows for key processes</li>
<li>State Diagrams - applicable, although usually associated with the state and lifespan of a single object instance, but it is still conceptually useful if you are maintaining state through other means</li>
<li>Sequence Diagram - applicable, although you will probably need to provide an arbitrary class name to attach your functions (if you are using namespaces, then possibly aggregate to these these instead?)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you might hit issues if you want to generate and round-trip code from your diagrams e.g. from a CASE tool such as Rational Rose - most will assume an OO implementation language (noting that the three Amigos are strongly associated with OO!)</p>

<p>I guess this begs the question as to why you would need to develop a procedural app using an OO language and document it with OO techniques?</p>

<p>If typeof returned undefined for your functions, chances are there was some parse-time error of the javascript. This means that something that firefox was lenient about accepting in your code, other browsers weren't.</p>

I saw several errors in your code, but I'm not sure if it would be the cause of the problem.

<p>I'm not sure if this is what you are asking for, but you could relative position #some_image to the bottom of the div wrapping the two you have mentioned. Otherwise, just put the text and the image in the same div, like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="some_div"&gt;
     This is some text.
   &lt;img src="some_img.png" /&gt;

<p>If you don't float the image, then the text should be aligned to the bottom line of the div and, thus, aligned to the bottom of the image.</p>

<p>Simplified version of my problem:</p>

<p>I have some variable, that contains some xml.
x = "foo</p>

<p>I'd like to generate XML that looks like this:

x &lt;-- contents of x

</p>

<p>So I have an xml builder partial that looks like
xml.map do 
  xml.other_stuff do 
  end
end</p>

<p>how do I insert x in there?</p>

<p>If the question isn't clear just yell at me and I'll retype.  3am does not a pristine query create!</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Constants in <code>#define</code>'s are replaced by the pre-processor before compilation. They are not exposed as variables.</p>

<p>You could add </p>

<pre><code>.elephant-list,
.aardvark-list,
.platypus-list,
</code></pre>

<p>in anticipation of future expansion also, but there comes a point when you cross from flexible to absurd. There is no reason to code special names for classes that you have no reason to expect will need to differ.</p>

<p>Should you find that they need to differ in the future, add them. Also from an aesthetic view having <code>.listing</code> divisions share the same styles is a Good Thing.</p>

<p>fun question, probably should be community wiki.</p>

<p>Look at number of finalists by countries: <a href="http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/regions" rel="nofollow">http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/regions</a>.  notice number of people from East Europe and Russia.  those places have very strong C++ communities, as well as Java, for number of reasons.</p>

<p>look at number languages in qualifiers: <a href="http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/languages/0" rel="nofollow">http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/languages/0</a> and finals: <a href="http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/languages/6" rel="nofollow">http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/languages/6</a>.  C++ starts out less than half and has 75 percent in finals.  either good programmers prefer C++ or C++ makes the programmers.  Probably by the time you master C++, other things become trivial.</p>

<p>You are free to draw your own conclusions though.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I want to extend the asp.net validators such that I can make one validator dependent on another. The situation I have is that we have to validate a date in a textbox. Normally I would just use a combination of a RequiredFieldValidator (to ensure the date is provided), CompareValidator (to ensure the date is a date) and finally a RangeValidator (to ensure the date is within the required limit).</p>

<p>The problem with this is that the validators do not depend on each other, so as a result the user would see possibly all three messages at once for each validator when really all we want them to see is the most relevant message, i.e. if they entered "abc" in the date text box it would not be appropriate to show them the message saying the date was not in the valid range (even though technically I suppose this is true).</p>

<p>Currently to provide this kind of functionality we use a CustomValidator and just put all three validations within the server validate event handler and change the error message programmatically depending on what validation failed.</p>

<p>I would like to standardize this a bit more as it happens quite a bit in this application, I figure if I can make the validators dependent on each other this will solve the problem and also allow us to make use of the client side validation rather than having to do a postback especially to handle the custom validation.</p>

<p>The idea is that if one validator is dependent on another if that "master" is valid then the depended will perform its normal validation (EvaluateIsValid()) otherwise if the master validator is not valid then the other dependent validators will be valid.</p>

<p>I have come up with the following solution by inheriting from the various validator controls that already have been provided in the framework.</p>

<pre><code>public class RequiredFieldDependentValidator : RequiredFieldValidator
{
    [Description("The validation control to depend on for determining if validation should occur")]
    public string ValidationControlToDependOn
    {
        get
        {
            object obj = ViewState["ValidationControlToDependOn"];
            if (obj != null) return (string) obj;
            return null;
        }
        set
        {
            Control control = FindControl(value);
            if (control is IValidator)
                ViewState["ValidationControlToDependOn"] = value;
            else
                throw new HttpException("ValidationControlToDependOn is not a validation control");
        }
    }

    protected override bool EvaluateIsValid()
    {
        IValidator validationControlToDependOn = FindControl(ValidationControlToDependOn) as IValidator;

        if(validationControlToDependOn != null)
        {
            return !validationControlToDependOn.IsValid || base.EvaluateIsValid();
        }

        return base.EvaluateIsValid();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Currently I have just coded it for the RequiredFieldValidator, ideally I would like to provide this functionality for all of the validators but I cannot see a way to do this without copying the above code into a similar class for each individual type of validator I want to provide this functionality for thus if there are any problems I'm going to have to go back and change this code on each validator type individually.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can "centralise" this code and have it easily used in the validators without having to write the entire validators from scratch just so I can change the class they inherit from further down the line.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
^^

<p>I always use the same strategy for this: I never try to "understand" the code base as a whole,  and I usually try to follow the request flow. I read enough of the documentation to determine what is necessary to use the application, and I read <em>that</em> code (Keep all source code loaded in your IDE). </p>

<p>For example, in struts you'll be installing a servlet filter in web.xml. Start reading the filter and follow the path a single request takes through your stack.</p>

<p>Likewise for spring, there are two main entry points, the filter and "getBean", both of which are mentioned real early in the documentation. Read those two. </p>

<p>For both of these cases you'll find one or two classes that represent the "core" of the framework real quickly. Read those really well and let actual use cases &amp; needs drive your further exploration.</p>

<p>Approaching "understanding" of an open source library (or any other code base for that matter) by trying to find all the pieces is usually not a very good way of approaching these things, it will usually just lead nowhere because a lot of these things contain too much code. When following the request flow I find making diagrams can also be quite distracting, it tends to draw attention/focus away from understanding (and since my understanding increases rapidly most of them are out-of-date even before they reach the printer). </p>

<p>I am trying to read all content from a text file. Here is the code which I wrote. </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

static char *readcontent(const char *filename)
{
    char *fcontent = NULL, c;
    int index = 0, pagenum = 1;
    FILE *fp;
    fp = fopen(filename, "r");

    if(fp) {
        while((c = getc(fp)) != EOF) {
            if(!fcontent || index == PAGE_SIZE) {
                fcontent = (char*) realloc(fcontent, PAGE_SIZE * pagenum + 1);
                ++pagenum;
            }
            fcontent[index++] = c;
        }
        fcontent[index] = '\0';
        fclose(fp);
    }
    return fcontent;

static void freecontent(char *content)
{
    if(content) {
        free(content);
        content = NULL;
    }
}

<p>This is the usage</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    char *content;
    content = readcontent("filename.txt");
    printf("File content : %s\n", content);
    fflush(stdout);
    freecontent(content);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since I am new to C, I wonder whether this code looks perfect? Do you see any problems/improvements? </p>

<p>Compiler used : GCC. But this code is expected to be cross platform. </p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Here is the updated code with <code>fread</code> and <code>ftell</code>.</p>

    FILE *fp;

    fp = fopen(filename, "r");

        fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);
        fsize = ftell(fp);
        rewind(fp);

        fcontent = (char*) malloc(sizeof(char) * fsize);

<p>I am wondering what will be the relative complexity of this function? </p>

<p>Usually the reason of that is some problem in DevTools JS code.</p>

<p>It is a chance that problem will be solved by chrome restart.
Such kind of problems can happen when chrome is upgrading at background.</p>

<p>The other reason of that can be some changes which you made in DevTools.js.
Of cause if you have done some changes :)</p>

<p>You can troubleshoot such problem by another instance of DevTools.
As example you can try to load DevTools.html page into Safari, open WebInspector for it and check console messages.</p>

<p>In Java, all fields in an interface are implicitly static and final. 
But its considered bad practice. To qoute Joshua Bloch from Effective Java:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The constant interface pattern is a
  poor use of interfaces. That a class
  uses some constants internally is an
  implementation detail. Implementing a
  constant interface causes this
  implementation detail to leak into the
  class's exported API. It is of no
  consequence to the users of a class
  that the class implements a constant
  interface. In fact, it may even
  confuse them. Worse, it represents a
  commitment: if in a future release the
  class is modified so that it no longer
  needs to use the constants, it still
  must implement the interface to ensure
  binary compatibility. If a nonfinal
  class implements a constant interface,
  all of its subclasses will have their
  namespaces polluted by the constants
  in the interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As to why it is considered bad practice, I think a class implementing an interface with constant fields is exposing  these in  the interface to outside code which consumes this class which in most cases is not what is required.</p>

<p>Given a void pointer to a "blob" of raw memory, there are two ways of writing something onto it.</p>

<p>The first way is to use placement new. This method has the advantage of calling the ctor automagically when we are dealing with class-types. However, when I deal with non-class types, would it be better to do a cast instead? I imagine it could possibly be faster.</p>

<p>(pLocation is a void pointer to a blob of memory</p>

<pre><code>// ----- Is this better -----
*reinterpret_cast&lt;char*&gt;(pLocation) = pattern;

// ----- Or is this better -----
::new(pLocation) char(pattern);

<p>If the model <code>has_attached_file :pic</code>, you should be able to just point the <code>pic</code> attribute at some file and all should be dandy.</p>

<p>In OS4 the idea is sold to client is that the app is opened in background, and even if the user is on another app, the app can push data to server on regular basis (which would trigger push notifications btw)
BUT on what i read on the internet is that IOS4 multitasking is a fake one :
- it freezes the app, and doesn't leave it in background
- the developper has to specify the app must work in IOS4 (iOS4 qualification process) to ensure that returning on the app won't start agin from beginning</p>

<p>So can anyone confirm that in iOS4 on iphone 4 the app can push data to server in background process ?</p>
^^
<p>First of all, as you have pointed <code>C++</code> and <code>Java</code> are mainstream languages. These automatically means that people who start doing programming competitions will be introduced to them first - by the way who learns <code>Lisp</code> as a first language:) I also participate regularly in such competitions - I use <code>C++</code> to compete, although my favorite language is <code>Java</code>. It is just I want to practice another language apart from <code>Java</code> - also <code>C++</code> is a little bit less verbose and runs faster which is important for programming competitions.
Now to my point - people become experts first in mainstream languages. To participate in programming competitions you must have quite a good grasp of the language you are using. You don't have time to search on the internet for stupid things - like forgot a construct. It is just that speed is an important factor there. To use <code>Lisp</code> in a competition, you must be fond of it. I don't think there are such many people out there. Correct me if I am wrong. And honestly the pros you have mentioned like simplifies backtracking: In whatever language backtracking is easy - declare a method and just call it again for every possible outcome. It couldn't be simpler.  I haven't felt till now that the language I am using is trying to trip up my feet for programming competitions.</p>
^^
<p>I don't know much about measurement points, but there seems to be a function module to read the documents (MEASUREM_DOCUM_RFC_SINGLE_002) if you know the keys. If there is no RFC module to get a list of $foo according to a set of selection criteria, you could always try RFC_READ_TABLE to get the keys directly from the database table. If you were programming in Java, I'd recommend some wrapper classes I've written - don't know whether a similar thing already exists for C#.</p>
^^
<p>Why we all speak English and not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto" rel="nofollow">Esperanto</a>? Well, it just happened so. Even though English is inconsistent and bloated and Esperanto is intentionally designed as 'better tool'.</p>

<p>Thus, one reason is a tradition. In most schools programming is still taught in C/C++, Java, Pascal or even Basic. And participate in those contests mostly students, which choose language they know better.<br>
Also, you can notice that most algorithmic books feature psedudocode in style of Pascal or Ada, and very very rarely - Lisp. I don't know why, perhaps also a tradition. Or perhaps it's just not so good for the algorithms.</p>

<p>Another reason would be speed. Although it's not a problem for Google Code Jam, in almost all contests 2x speed gap is a difference between 'Accepted' and 'Time Limit' verdicts.<br>
In other words, if optimal algorithm in C++ runs 10 times faster than in Ruby, it may mean that sub-optimal algorithm in C++ will still be faster than a good one in Ruby. And contest authors usually don't want to allow O(n^2) submissions, if O(n*logn) can be achieved.</p>
^^
<p>In my opinion the best solution is socket, but you say that you can't implement the server side for this.</p>

<p>You could also implement it with push notifications. You can receive the push also when your app is running and send all the data you need inside the push. Usually chat messages are short...</p>

<p>If you don't want to mess with push notifications on the server then the only thing left, as long as I know, is the polling.</p>
^^
<p>I would like to build an app which retrieves images from my server.
My problem is that I want it to work in the <strong>background</strong> and only when there is a 'new image' to load.</p>

<p>It seems like what I need is very similar to PUSH notifications: </p>

<ul>
<li>Work in the background</li>
<li>Only when there is 'something new' to load.</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess what I want became possible with the new iOS4.
Please tell me if this is feasible.
Any links for how to even start thinking about it would be great. 
Thanks.</p>

<p>Microsoft Detours does not include those files or a "hook engine". I suspect whatever you download is incomplete.</p>

<p>You should try look into the functions <code>fsize</code> (<strong>About fsize, see update below</strong>) and <code>fread</code>. This could be a huge performance improvement.</p>

<p>Use <code>fsize</code> to get the size of the file you are reading. Use this size to do one alloc of memory only. (<strong>About fsize, see update below. The idea of getting the size of the file and doing one alloc is still the same</strong>). </p>

<p>Use <code>fread</code> to do block reading of the file. This is much faster than single charecter reading of the file.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>long size = fsize(fp);
fcontent = malloc(size);
fread(fcontent, 1, size, fp);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Not sure that fsize is cross platform but you can use this method to get the size of the file:</p>

<pre><code>fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END); 
size = ftell(fp);
fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_SET); 
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you unbind before you try binding again with the same <code>ServiceConnection</code>.</p>

<p>Also, you typically do not need both <code>startService()</code> and <code>bindService()</code>. You NEVER need both <code>startService()</code> and <code>bindService(..., BIND_AUTO_CREATE)</code>. Unless you have a very specific reason you need to use <code>startService()</code> as well as <code>bindService()</code>, I would only use one.</p>

<p>Why Java impl choose merge sort over quick sort? and why do they copy the content to an array?</p>

<p>API: "The sorting algorithm is a modified mergesort (in which the merge is omitted if the highest element in the low sublist is less than the lowest element in the high sublist). This algorithm offers guaranteed n log(n) performance. This implementation dumps the specified list into an array, sorts the array, and iterates over the list resetting each element from the corresponding position in the array. This avoids the n2 log(n) performance that would result from attempting to sort a linked list in place."</p>
^^
<p>People often <code>realloc</code> to twice the existing size to get amortized constant time instead of linear. This makes the buffer no more than twice as large, which is usually okay, and you have the option of reallocating back down to the correct size after you're done.</p>

<p>But even better is to <code>stat(2)</code> for the file size and allocate once (with some extra room if the file size is volatile). </p>

<p>Also, why you don't either <code>fgets(3)</code> instead of reading character by character, or, even better, <code>mmap(2)</code> the entire thing (or the relevant chunk if it's too large for memory).</p>

<p>A vital reason might be that every contests don't support languages like python or prolog.

And <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=help&amp;d2=codingWindow" rel="nofollow">TopCoder also supports only C++, Java, C# and VB</a>. It is natural for the contestants that they will choose one language that is available in every contest. Another reason might be execution speed. And yes, another reason is these are the languages that most of the people learn first.</p>

<p>If the XML is using namespaces, those are part of the element name and they should not be parsed as if they were unnamespaced elements. Therefore that is not an option in JAXB. A <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/277502/jaxb-how-to-ignore-namespace-during-unmarshalling-xml-document">previous question</a> along these lines have given the only solution as sanitizing the XML prior to unmarshalling and removing all namespaces, with the JAXB objects bound to unnamespaced names.</p>

<p>You could just do an explode or a preg_split and count the pieces:</p>

<pre><code>$parts = preg_split('/\s/', $subject, -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);
if (count($parts) == 1)
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>An alternative with explode:</p>

<pre><code>$subject = trim(subject);
$parts = explode(' ', $subject);
</code></pre>

<p>This works too if you are certain there are only spaces.</p>

<p>I think it's weird that Java chose to allow this. </p>

<p>An interface is a contract for a Role. That is, it's an spec that all objects must implement in order to be considered as suitable/swappable candidates for that Role. It should contain <em>the messages/methods that the Role responds to and the notifications that it triggers for interested listeners</em>.</p>

<p>Fields are an implementation detail (and your example contains actual implementation dictating the return value for the INSTANCE field too) and do not belong within the contract. If you wanted to map this to C#, you should probably move it to an <strong>abstract base class</strong>, which allows default implementation to be specified in addition to specifying some members that derived classes must also implement.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.getfinch.com/finch/confirmation/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, when you submit the form the page seems to stay as it is and it just shows a message at the top of the page saying that the message was sent.</p>

<p>The only part I understood was the following code:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(function() {
var returnMessage = ['I got the message! I will get back to you as soon as I can.'];

    jQuery('body').showMessage({

      'thisMessage':  returnMessage,
      'className':  'success',
      'opacity':  95,
      'displayNavigation': false,
      'autoClose':  true,
      'delayTime':  4000

      });
    });
</code></pre>

<p>I know that the code above makes the message appear at the top of the page.</p>

<p>But I can't see how is this Javascript code connected to the form.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain that to me? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Java guys traded the worst-case scenario with the avg case, as you probably know, quick sort might run in O(n^2) in the worst case..</p>

<p>You can read in the API, sorting a linked list in-place is more complex n^2log(n)</p>

<p>Merge sort is stable which the isn't true for the efficient version of quicksort.
(which can be highly important upon sorting objects + many programmers take that as granted when they use Collections.sort())</p>
^^
<p>The documentation gives the answer to both your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This algorithm offers guaranteed n log(n) performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Merge sort doesn't have the pathological cases of quicksort</p>

<p>One further advantage of merge sort over quicksort is that merge sort is stable; quicksort is typically unstable. (Obviously with enough effort you can <em>make</em> it stable, but I believe it's relatively expensive to do so.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This avoids the n<sup>2</sup> log(n) performance
  that would result from attempting to
  sort a linked list in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Copying into an array first means you're not relying on the complexity of the original collection's access to individual elements. I suppose it <em>could</em> look at whether the list implements <code>RandomAccess</code> and sort in place if so, but <code>RandomAccess</code> was only introduced in 1.4.</p>
^^
<p>You could override the Validate method in you page base. To add the validation dependency information in the page you can implement a not rendered control:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;my:ValidationDependency TargetControl="RegExp1" Dependency="Required1" /&gt;
</code></pre>
^^
<p>This should work for you:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM pages p1
LEFT JOIN pages p2 ON p1.slug = p2.slug AND p1.updated &lt; p2.updated
WHERE p2.updated IS NULL
ORDER BY p1.updated DESC
</code></pre>

^^
<ul>
<li><p>Merge sort has guaranteed O(n log n) behaviour. Quick sort has a worst-case performance of O(n^2). So in some cases, merge sort is faster, and it has a better upper bound.</p></li>
<li><p>An in-place sort like quick sort doesn't work on linked lists, as your quote mentions. To work predictably for all types of collections, a copy is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Quick sort by itself is not stable. Stability is sometimes desirable, and something that APIs should offer.</p></li>

<p>Here's a function for use as an event handler that makes use of <code>this</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function validate() {
  if (this.val() == '') {
    return false;
  }
}

$(':input').change(validate);
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the same function rewritten to take an argument, so that I can call it explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>function validate(field) {
  if ($(field).val() == '') {
    return false;
  }
}

validate($('#customer_name'));
</code></pre>

<p>How can I rewrite my <code>validate</code> function to make it suitable for use as <em>both</em> an event handler, and as a standalone function for me to call?</p>
^^
<p>It looks like the page uses the <a href="http://showmessage.dingobytes.com/" rel="nofollow">showMessage</a> jQuery plugin. This plugin simply displays a message at the top, it has no connection with a form. When you navigate to the link you provided there is no need to submit a form to see the message.</p>

<p>The way it works is that you fill the form at the <a href="http://www.getfinch.com/contact/" rel="nofollow">Contact</a> page and once you submit it you are redirected to the <a href="http://www.getfinch.com/confirmation/" rel="nofollow">Confirmation</a> page which simply contains the notification message at the top.</p>

<p>Big libraries were a selling point for Java in ACM ICPC. It's handy to be able to realize you want some random data structure or algorithm and just pull it out of the standard libraries.</p>
^^
<p>There are various ways to do this. One is to use the second one taking the field as a parameter and set the event handler using a closure:</p>

<pre><code>function validate(field) {
  if ($(field).val() == '') {
    return false;
  }
}

// Use anonymous function to pass "this" to validate.
$(':input').change(function() { validate(this); });

// Unchanged.
validate($('#customer_name'));
</code></pre>

<p>Another way is to use the first form and use <a href="http://www.webreference.com/js/column26/apply.html" rel="nofollow">apply()</a> to call it with an overridden <code>this</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function validate() {
  if ($(this).val() == '') {
    return false;
  }
}

// Unchanged.
$(':input').change(validate);

// Use `$(...)` as "this" when calling validate.
validate.apply($('#customer_name'));
</code></pre>

<p>Great question! As someone who has dabbled in programming contests a bit myself, I may have something to say.</p>

<p>[Let's get the standard disclaimer out of the way: contest programming is only loosely related to "programming in the real world", and while it tests algorithmic and problem-solving skills and the ability to come up with fast bug-free working code under time pressure, it does not necessarily correlate with being able to build large software projects, write maintainable code, etc (beyond the fact that well-structured programs are easier to debug).]</p>

<p>Now for some answers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>C++/Java are more common than other languages in the real world as well, so you'd expect to see a higher proportion anywhere. (But it's even higher in the contest population.)</p></li>
<li><p>Many of these participants are students, or got into contests as students, and C++/Java are more common "first languages" that students learn. (Undergrad students these days may start with Scheme, Haskell, Python, etc., but high-schoolers (often self-taught) less often.) In fact, many of the Eastern European participants still use Pascal, and are more amazing with it than the rest of us will ever be with any language.</p></li>
<li><p>The school- and college-level contests usually use these languages. The International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) allows only C, C++ and Pascal (or maybe it allows Java now; I haven't kept up), and the ACM Intercollegiate Programming Contest (ACM ICPC) allows only C, C++ and Java. TopCoder allows C++, Java, C# and VB (really :p); and recently, Python. So you could say the "contest ecosystem" has more C++/Java programmers in it. Google Code Jam and <a href="http://ipsc.ksp.sk/" rel="nofollow">IPSC</a> are among the few contests that allow code in any language, actually.</p></li>
<li><p>Now the question is, in GCJ where the contestants are free to choose a language, why wouldn't they choose Python or Scheme? The most relevant factor is that these languages are <strong>slow</strong>. Sure, for most real-world programming they are easily fast enough, but for the tight loops that are often involved in getting a program to run under the n-second limit for all test cases, these languages don't cut it for any of the algorithmically more involved problems. (A problem designed to accept O(n log n) solutions but not &Theta;(n<sup>2</sup>) solutions for C/C++ frequently rules out even optimal O(n log n) solutions in slower languages. Even Java used to be given a handicap at USACO; I'm not sure this is still the case.)</p></li>
<li><p>Another factor is the libraries: C++ and Java have better libraries for frequently useful algorithms and data structures (e.g. red-black trees, C++'s next_permutation), while Python's libraries (good enough for the real world) are less useful here, and Prolog and Scheme... I don't know about their libraries. This is a relatively minor factor, because these programmers can write their own code when necessary. :-)</p></li>
<li><p>General-purpose multi-paradigm languages are more useful for just getting things done within the time constraints of the contest, than languages that force a philosophy or way of doing things on you. This is why Prolog will always remain unpopular, for instance. (General philosophy: some languages are "enabling" languages that let you do anything including shooting yourself in the foot, some are "directing" that force you to do things the right way.) This is also why C++ is three times more popular than Java in the general contest participants, and much more popular among the top contestants. Since code doesn't have to be read by anyone else, it's ok and even useful to have loop macros like <code>FOR(i,n)</code> (less code to type, and more importantly less chance of making a bug when in a hurry). Nothing against Java, there are a few top programmers who use Java too. :-)</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, although many of these top programmers may have C++/Java/Pascal as their "first language", they are not good <em>because</em> of their language, so you don't have to despair about that. Many of these same programmers have won contests like the <a href="http://www.icfpcontest.org/" rel="nofollow">ICFP contest</a> even with intentionally using crazy languages like shell scripts, m4 (used in autoconf), and assembly (the team named "You Can't Spell Awesome Without ASM").</p></li>

<p>It depends on what background you mean. </p>

<p>If you mean that your application is running and you have some thread to get the image in the background thread, it is possible. </p>

<p>If you mean that your application is suspended and you still want to use PUSH notification and get the image. I am afraid that it is impossible. When your application is in the background, it has very limited amount of time that it can run to finish its current task. When that time is out, your application cannot do anything.</p>

<p>You can receive some push notification and local notification like GPS, server notification when your application is suspended, but you can only receive the server notification and cannot download the new image. Here is the instruction from Apple Dev documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the operating system delivers a
  local or push notification and the
  target application is not running in
  the foreground, it presents the
  notification (alert, icon badge
  number, sound). If there is a
  notification alert and the user taps
  the action button (or moves the action
  slider), the application launches and
  calls the UIApplicationDelegate method
  application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:,
  passing in the local-notification
  object or remote-notification payload.
  If the application is running in the
  foreground when the notification is
  delivered, the
  application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:
  or
  application:didReceiveLocalNotification:
  method of the application delegate is
  invoked.</p>

<p>The solution depends on the compiler and linker which you use. Always is that <strong>not</strong> <code>main</code> is the real entry point of the application. The real entry point makes some initializations and call for example <code>main</code>. If you write programs for Windows using Visual Studio, you can use /ENTRY switch of the linker to overwrite the default entry point <code>mainCRTStartup</code> and call <code>func()</code> instead of <code>main()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef NDEBUG
void mainCRTStartup()
{
    ExitProcess (func());
}
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>If is a standard practice if you write the most small application. In the case you will receive restrictions in the usage of C-Runtime functions. You should use Windows API function instead of C-Runtime function. For example instead of <code>printf("This is func \n")</code> you should use <code>OutputString(TEXT("This is func \n"))</code> where <code>OutputString</code> are implemented only with respect of <code>WriteFile</code> or <code>WriteConsole</code>:</p>

<pre><code>static HANDLE g_hStdOutput = INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE;
static BOOL g_bConsoleOutput = TRUE;

BOOL InitializeStdOutput()
{
    g_hStdOutput = GetStdHandle (STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
    if (g_hStdOutput == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
        return FALSE;

    g_bConsoleOutput = (GetFileType (g_hStdOutput) &amp; ~FILE_TYPE_REMOTE) != FILE_TYPE_DISK;
#ifdef UNICODE
    if (!g_bConsoleOutput &amp;&amp; GetFileSize (g_hStdOutput, NULL) == 0) {
        DWORD n;

        WriteFile (g_hStdOutput, "\xFF\xFE", 2, &amp;n, NULL);
    }
#endif

    return TRUE;
}

void Output (LPCTSTR pszString, UINT uStringLength)
{
    DWORD n;

    if (g_bConsoleOutput) {
#ifdef UNICODE
        WriteConsole (g_hStdOutput, pszString, uStringLength, &amp;n, NULL);
#else
        CHAR szOemString[MAX_PATH];
        CharToOem (pszString, szOemString);
        WriteConsole (g_hStdOutput, szOemString, uStringLength, &amp;n, NULL);
#endif
    }
    else
#ifdef UNICODE
        WriteFile (g_hStdOutput, pszString, uStringLength * sizeof (TCHAR), &amp;n, NULL);
#else
    {
        //PSTR pszOemString = _alloca ((uStringLength + sizeof(DWORD)));
        CHAR szOemString[MAX_PATH];
        CharToOem (pszString, szOemString);
        WriteFile (g_hStdOutput, szOemString, uStringLength, &amp;n, NULL);
    }
#endif
}

void OutputString (LPCTSTR pszString)
{
    Output (pszString, lstrlen (pszString));
}

<p>you can have <code>ValidationControlToDependOn</code> property as of type List and add the validators into the list. So we can assume that the validator added later depends upon the validator added before it.</p>

<p>I have a class that exposes two methods:</p>

<p> - <code>GetObject</code></p>

<p>Gets a single object, or returns null if there are none.</p>

<p> - <code>WaitForObject</code></p>

<p>Gets a single object, or waits until their is one.</p>

<p>An example implementation:</p>

<p>    </p>

<pre><code>    class MyClass
    {
        MyStack stack;
        public object GetObject()
        {
            return stack.Pop();
        }
        public object WaitForObject()
        {
            object returnValue;
            while (returnValue == null)
                returnValue = stack.Pop()
            return returnValue
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>With the assumption that <code>MyStack</code> is thread safe, how can I make <code>MyClass</code> thread safe? I.e.</p>

<p> - <code>GetObject</code> should never block
 - <code>Thread</code> doing <code>WaitForObject</code> should get any new objects added to the stack instead of <code>GetObject</code>.</p>

<p>For bonus points, how can users adding objects to the stack notify any listeners that a new object is available? (eliminating the need for polling)</p>

<p>Use a fallback to <code>this</code> if <code>field</code> is not given as an argument.</p>

validate($('#someInput'));    // using a parameter
</code></pre>
^^
<p>Okay, I found the answer.</p>

<p>This is what needs to be done. For the articles (blog) page, at the top section you need to place the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php // TOP PICTURE DEFINITION FOR ARTICLES PAGE
        if ( is_home() ) {
            $toppic = 'page1.png';
        }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in your page.php file, you can control the picture at the top for all other pages (except 404, where you'd need to put a is_404() in your 404.php. So this is what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    // TOP PICTURE DEFINITIONS
    if ( is_page('english') ) {
        $toppic = 'page1.png';
    }
    if ( is_page('aboutus') ) {
        $toppic = 'page1.png';
    }
    if ( is_page('newspaper') ) {
        $toppic = 'page1.png';
    }
    else {
        $toppic = 'page1.png';
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, in order to implement this, use the following HTML/php syntax:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="&lt;?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?&gt;/images/&lt;?php echo $toppic ?&gt;" alt="page1" id="mainPageImg" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That's all. Phew. Finally got it to work :) Had to do it for a client, too!</p>

<pre><code>$names = explode(' ', trim($name));
if (empty($names))
    $letters = 'undefined';

else 
    $letters = substr($names[1],0,1);

<p>Hi In my ASP.NET MVC project i have following tag in in web.config file</p>

<p><code>&lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;
      &lt;forms loginUrl="~/Account/LogOn" timeout="2880"/&gt;
    &lt;/authentication&gt;</code></p>

<p>This causes even the authenticated users but unauthorized resource requested users to redirect to logon page. but i need only to redirect this page if user try to access unauthorized page and not already authenticated(logged on) and redirect to custom page.</p>

<p>Is there easy way to do this without writing custom action filter?</p>
^^
<p>It is probably slower and certainly more complex than:</p>

<pre><code>while((c = getc(fp)) != EOF) {
    putchar(c);
}
</code></pre>

<p>which does the same thing as your code.</p>
^^
<p>If <code>MyStack</code> is guaranteed to be thread safe then <code>MyClass</code> is also thread safe. In the two methods you are using only local variables so the methods are reentrant.</p>

<p>Currently users cannot add objects to the stack because the <code>stack</code> field is not visible outside the class. Also I don't see from your code how do listeners will subscribe to any events so that they are notified if an object is added. So you could have a method allowing to add elements to the stack and an event that will be triggered in this case.</p>

  <p>So the question boils down to: are

  than IronPython or vice versa?
  Assuming you are equally confident in
  both? Or are they exactly equivalent
  for all practical purposes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As is usually the case, "it depends on what you're doing" But since you asked, start here:</p>

<p><strong>Toolset diversity</strong></p>

<p>In my point of view, IronPython is essentially the same as C# with a little different syntax -- I know, its a sweeping generalization for two languages with wholly dissimilar type systems, but they're no much else I can say about yet another imperative, OO language. Whether its C#, or Java, or C++, or Python, you solve languages using roughly the same techniques, idioms, strategies, style, etc. If you're  a .NET developer, you've almost certainly worked with C# or VB.NET, and you've already been writing code in an imperative style for as long as you've been using the languages.</p>

<p>The biggest point in favor of F# is simply that it encourages more functional programming styles, downplays abstractions through OO inheritance in favor of function composition, immutability as a default instead of as an after thought, and so on. If you want to write functional code, you need to use a functional language.</p>

<p>Granted, you <em>can</em> write functional style in C# and Python, but functional features are grafted on as an afterthought. Python lacks multiline lambdas, and C# is too verbose and occasionally <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2422520/why-does-my-performance-slow-to-a-crawl-i-move-methods-into-a-base-class">buggy</a> to make use of functional style in the places where you want to use it, C# in particular has a whole <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/512166/c-the-foreach-identifier-and-closures">boatload of gotchas</a> regarding delegates and capturing local variables, both languages lack tail-call optimizations almost everywhere that you'd want to use them, C#'s type inference is a joke compared to F#. I've tried using C# as a functional language with hilariously bad results :)</p>

<p>Now most people might concede that problems make it difficult, but not impossible to program in a functional style using C# or Python. However, in my experience, its not the languages that make it impossible, its the programmers on your team. If you've got 10 or 12 people writing code in an imperative language, you won't be able to enforce a functional style for very long -- the languages don't do anything to discourage imperative style. And since programmers already code in that style, that's what you get. Unless you have some really hardcore and slightly masochistic FP enthusiasts on your team, I don't think could enforce a purely functional programming style in an imperative language for very long.</p>

<p>The best argument in favor of F# isn't necessarily functional programming itself, but really diversity of your toolset. You get a bigger ROI pairing up F# and C# (different programming paradigm and similar type system) than pairing up IronPython and C# (same programming paradigm and different type system).</p>

<p><strong>Case study of my company</strong></p>

<p>Ok, so with that being said, I've been trying to push for F# at my company. I won't go into a huge amount of detail on what we do, but essentially my team guides users through the process of ordering cable and phone services for companies like Time Warner, ComCast, and other cable providers.</p>

<p>Its really a more involved process than it sounds. For a start, there is a complicated rules engine which determines availability of products, dependencies and exclusions between products, etc. We walk the rule engine graph and build a decision tree out of it, then we hand the tree to a client so they can display it to the user and collect user input, client maps GUI back to our decision tree structure, we walk the tree and validate everything against the rules engine, etc.</p>

<p>I'd say 95% of our code is simply navigating, manipulating, and processing tree-like data structures. Right now, everything we write is C# and its kind of a mess. Incidentally, one of F#'s strengths is manipulating ASTs and symbolic processing (see a comparison of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/694651/what-task-is-best-done-in-a-functional-programming-style/694822#694822">C# and F# code for processing ASTs</a>), and its all possible because pattern matching is awesome.</p>

<p>Pattern matching is a real killer feature, its exactly what our C# code needs to clean it up, and that's why we need F#. We don't have any use for IronPython because its no better at symbolic processing than C#.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Functional programming paradigm and pattern matching are two killer features I enjoy with F# everyday. I could go about F#'s <code>async</code> threading model, message passing concurrency primitives, support of monads, novel features like active patterns, and so on, but those are all bullet point comments. For me, its those two killer features that make the case for F# over Python -- at least for my own projects.</p>

<p>To your first question, about the high availability of the subscription DB, you can use a cluster for failover. If the DB is down, then the Bus.Publish will throw an exception, yes. It is recommended to keep the subscription DB separate from your applicative DB to avoid having to bring it down when upgrading your app. This doesn't have to be a separate DB server, a separate DB on the same DB server will be fine.</p>

<p>About moving servers, this is usually managed at a DNS level where for a certain period of time you'll have both running, until communication moves over.</p>

<p>On your third question about distributors - don't share a distributor between different publishers or subscribers.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to not add/remove subscribers when doing these kinds of maintainenance activities. This usually simplifies things quite a bit.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I need some advice on how to use Moq in a unit test to make sure that my class under test is behaving how I want. That is the class under test publishes an Event Aggregator (from Prism) event and I need some way of asserting that this event has been raised in my test.</p>

<p>I don't have a lot of resource at work and am finding it difficult to know how to set this up.</p>

<p>I have :-</p>

<pre><code>public SomeEvent : CompositePresentationEvent&lt;SomeEvent&gt;
{
   EventPayload
}

public SomeClass
{
     void Allocate(){EventAggregator.Publish&lt;SomeEvent&gt;}
}

public SomeService : IService
{
     SomeService(){ EventAggregator.Subscribe&lt;SomeEvent&gt;(DoSomething)}
     void DoSomething(SomeEvent evt){}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think that if my test is for SomeClass I need to verify that if I call SomeClass.Allocate a SomeEvent message is being published. How is this done?</p>

<p>Do I also need to verify that a mocked SomeService is receiving the SomeEvent? Or is that a seperate unit test that belongs to SomeService unit test and not SomeClass?</p>

<p>In any event, not sure how to set any of this up so any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Polling usually involves some form of sleep - the loop in your example would be a tight loop that would throttle the thead all the time.  Add a <code>Thread.Sleep(100)</code> call, or some other sensible value, to poll over time.</p>

<p>The other way to wait would be to register a callback, or have the stack expose a blocking <code>Pop</code> method, either way, these would be implemented in the <code>Stack</code> class in your example.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Answer:</strong> Your class would need to expose an event, when they add an object to the stack, it would fire this event.</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass 
    { 
        MyStack stack; 
        public object GetObject() 
        { 
            return stack.Pop(); 
        } 
        public object WaitForObject() 
        { 
            object returnValue; 
            while (returnValue == null) 
                returnValue = stack.Pop() 
            return returnValue 
        } 
        public void AddObject(object o)
        {
            stack.Push(o);
            OnObjectAdded();
        }
        public event EventHandler ObjectAdded;

        private void OnObjectAdded()
        {
            if (ObjectAdded != null)
                ObjectAdded(this, EventArgs.Empty);
        }
    }

<p>You have to add a <code>[System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Association]</code> attribute. For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    // [...]

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Association("User_Roles", "UserId", "RoleId")]
    public ICollection&lt;Role&gt; Roles { get; set; }
}

public class Role
{
    // [...]

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Association("Role_Users", "RoleId", "UserId")]
    public ICollection&lt;User&gt; Users { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the association is intended to be bi-directional, you must add this attribute on <em>both</em> the <code>User.Roles</code> and the <code>Role.Users</code> properties.</p>
^^
<p>system() will return a code indicating what your C program returned or if it was terminated by a signal; assuming the later is not the case, you can do</p>

<pre><code>$exitcode = system('a.out');
print "return code was ", $exitcode &gt;&gt; 8, "\n";
</code></pre>

<p>If you also wish to capture the output, you can use backticks and the code will be in the $? variable.</p>

<pre><code>$output = `a.out`;
$exitcode = $?;
print "return code was ", $exitcode &gt;&gt; 8, "\n";
print "output was:\n", $output;
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to use a module like IPC::Cmd that has several other features you may want.</p>

<p>I had to do exactly the same for one of my sites. You can follow the following steps</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you've cPanel on your server, create a subdomain <code>*</code>, if not, you'd have to set-up an A record in your DNS (for BIND see <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/10/wildcard-dns-and-sub-domains/" rel="nofollow">http://ma.tt/2003/10/wildcard-dns-and-sub-domains/</a>). On your dev. server you'd be far better off faking subdomains by adding each to your <code>hosts</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>(If you used cPanel you won't have to do this). You'll have to add soemthing like the following to your apache vhosts file. It largely depends on what type of server (shared or not) you're running. THE FOLLOWING CODE IS NOT COMPLETE. IT'S JUST TO GIVE DIRECTION. NOTE: <code>ServerAlias example.com *.example.com</code> is important.  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80&gt;  
        DocumentRoot /var/www/  
        ServerName example.com  
        ServerAlias example.com *.example.com  
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Next, since you can use the PHP script to check the "Host" header and find out the subdomain and serve content accordingly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I think the title is self-explanatory. Many times I have small typos and I get unexpected results when trying to access undefined hash keys.

<p>I'm trying to set up mongodb on webfaction. It works fine, currently running on port 36505 on the server. I can connect to it on the server just fine. But per the firewall, I can't connect to 36505 on the server from the 'net.</p>

<p>I can expose the port by mapping the port to port 80 under a sub-path. So I can make 1.1.1.1:36505 to 1.1.1.1:80/mongodb</p>

<p>My question is how do I actually connect to that? I'm not sure if mongo supports subpaths on port 80 or not...</p>

<p>All that this line does in <code>web.config</code> is to simply define the timeout of the authentication cookie and the login url. It is your code that decides which parts of the site are authenticated or no, by for example decorating your controllers and/or actions with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.authorizeattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>[Authorize]</code></a> attribute.</p>

<p>I think your problem is that all of your methods EventsController are declared to be private. Private methods cannot be called as actions - so you are having problems.</p>

<p>Try to move private declaration and redirect_if_not_logged_in to the end of the file, i.e. after the destroy method.</p>

<p>The simplest option would be</p>

<p>Your problem is probably that the image is not copied to the target. In xcode groups &amp; file pane, fine the node for targets, expand your app target and you'll see Copy Bundle resources expand it and you'll see all the files copied to the default resource bundle when you deploy your app to the sim/device. Only the resources found there will be available to your app. If you don't see your image there you can just drag it there and everything will work. </p>

<p>Now, in order to understand why this might happened we need to look at the different options for adding files to xcode.</p>

<p>When you're adding a file to xcode you are presented with a dialog that includes a few interesting and sometimes overlooked option.</p>

<p>The first - Should the file be copied to the project folder, or should it just point to the file original location. The safest way will be to always copy the files to the project's path. However for images (such in your case) I do it differently. I maintain a separate graphics folder for every app, I save images there (both sources, and final png). When I add an image I do not copy it to the project folder, rather xcode just points to its location. That way I can just edit the image in photoshop, do a rebuild, and the updated image will show up on the phone. Whats important to understand that the directory structure of files you include in the project have almost no meaning, files that appear in the Copy Bundle Resources for the target will always be copied to a single (and flat) bundle/"directory" on the phone. The only exception for this is if you actually add directories to xcode (Personally I recommend against it).</p>

<p>The second option when adding files, is to which targets to add the file. This is the list with checkboxes on the bottom, if when you added the image, your app target wasn't checked the file won't be included in the target Copy bundle resource, and won't be available for the phone.</p>

<p>A few caveats - When using references to files in other location, that location is relative to the project's path, so it's a good idea to keep all the files in directories below the project's root directory. That way you can still copy the entire project to a different location and it will still work.</p>

  <p>Is it possible to make our site's content at least accessible in all conditions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. But the more complicated and feature-rich the site becomes, the harder it gets to make it accessible.</p>

<p>A plain-text site will be accessible to nearly everybody, a website built in Flash only to a smaller group (and less accessible even to that group, but that's a different story).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should we think about all conditions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This depends entirely on your target audience, and the amount of time and money you're willing to invest.</p>

<p>For a government or a health agency, accessibility is very important. For a website with Flash games, probably less so.</p>

<p>You may want to try one of the following two lines:</p>

<pre><code>require_once STYLESHEETPATH . '/wp-load.php';
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>require_once TEMPLATEPATH . '/wp-load.php';
</code></pre>

<p>There is a slight difference between the STYLESHEETPATH constant and the TEMPLATEPATH constant. If you are developing a child theme, STYLESHEETPATH will be the child theme path, while TEMPLATEPATH will be the parent theme path.</p>

<p>On POSIX systems (e.g linux) you could get the same effect with the system call <code>mmap</code> that maps all your file in memory. It has an option to map that file <em>copy on write</em>, so you would overwrite your file if you change the buffer.</p>

<p>This would usually be much more efficient, since you leave as much as you can to the system. No need to do <code>realloc</code> or similar. </p>

<p>In particular, if you are only reading and several processes do that at the same time there would be only one copy in memory for the whole system.</p>

<p>I am trying to write a query which will count no of records in all the table of a schema and I am writing the following query.</p>

loop
execute immediate 'select count(*) into v_count from :a' using c1.tname;
dbms_output.put_line(c1.tname || '--'||v_count);
end loop;
end;
/
</code></pre>

<p>Where am I going wrong here?</p>
^^
<p>This is from a quick reading, so I might have missed a few issues.</p>

<p>First, <code>a = realloc(a, ...);</code> is wrong.  If <code>realloc()</code> fails, it returns <code>NULL</code>, but doesn't free the original memory.  Since you reassign to <code>a</code>, the original memory is lost (i.e., it is a memory leak).  The right way to do this is to do: <code>tmp = realloc(a, ...); if (tmp) a = tmp;</code> etc.</p>

<p>Second, about determining the file size using <code>fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);</code>, note that this may or may not work.  If the file is not random-access (such as <code>stdin</code>), you won't be able to go back to the beginning to read it.  Also, <code>fseek()</code> followed by <code>ftell()</code> may not give a meaningful result for binary files.  And for text files, it may not give you the right number of characters that can be read.  There is some useful information on this topic on <code>comp.lang.c</code> FAQ <a href="http://c-faq.com/osdep/filesize.html" rel="nofollow">question 19.2</a>.</p>

<p>Also, in your original code, you don't set <code>index</code> to 0 when it equals <code>PAGESIZE</code>, so if your file length is greater than <code>2*PAGESIZE</code>, you will overwrite the buffer.</p>

<p>Your <code>freecontent()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>static void freecontent(char *content)
{
    if(content) {
        free(content);
        content = NULL;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>is useless.  It only sets a copy of <code>content</code> to <code>NULL</code>.  It is just like if you wrote a function <code>setzero</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>void setzero(int i) { i = 0; }
</code></pre>

<p>A much better idea is to keep track of memory yourself and not free anything more or less than needed.</p>

<p>You shouldn't cast the return value of <code>malloc()</code> or <code>realloc()</code> in C, since a <code>void *</code> is implicitly converted to any other object pointer type in C.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>I think you can either go with push notifications, or XMPP (Jabber) server. </p>

<p>XMPP will allow your iphone app to receive data even when in the background using the new multitasking features (listening for a socket), and i'm pretty sure you should find ready to use servers for LAMP (or at least open source implementations).</p>

<p>Note that the iOS4 multitasking API doesn't support polling in the background, so your only other option should be push notifications. If you're new to push notifications, you can maybe use a service like <a href="http://urbanairship.com/" rel="nofollow">Urban Airship</a> that might make the process easier.</p>

<p>As a generalization: You can use all types except the class diagrams. If you could draw a class diagram, you should ask yourself, why you did not use classes in this case.</p>

<p>For all other diagrams, you can use parts of your app as "actors" or "components". It seems like you have not researched yet what these diagrams are used for and what you express with them. If you do that you should be able to determine which diagram makes sense for you.</p>

<p>Remember that each diagram should have a purpose. If you do it just for the sake of being there, then don't do it.</p>

<p>As I'm sitting here modifying <a href="http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php" rel="nofollow">PircBot</a>, I've just noticed that the entire backend was written to support Java <strong>1.1</strong>. It has a custom queue implementation, uses hash tables, custom producer/consumer implementations based on wait() and notify() signaling, etc. Even Commons-lang lacks any support for things that Java 5 brings to the table like generics. You can pull a bunch of other examples of very popular frameworks that try as hard as they can to support 1.1.</p>

<p>My question is why? Why are certain parts of the Java community refusing to support new versions? I go by this theory: Old versions use older versions of frameworks and older JVMs, newer versions use upgraded frameworks and JVMs. You upgrade everything with the software.</p>

<p>Now I can partially understand people still running Java 1.5, but 1.1? If your running anything before that then your obviously not upgrading the JVM because of stupid policies/scared of the unkown, and therefor aren't going to upgrade to newer versions of software. So why are we still supporting them?</p>

<p>On a related note, if you are writing a new framework should you support anything &lt;1.5? Should you try forking existing frameworks, upgrading it to 1.5, then talk to the maintainers about using it?</p>

<p>Much more specific discussions (this is about support in general):

<p>There are a couple of problems in you script:</p>

<p>Upon setting up the <code>choose folder</code> variables you have to put parentheses around <code>choose folder</code> in order to force the Finder to convert the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/applescript/conceptual/applescriptlangguide/reference/ASLR_classes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH1g-SW3" rel="nofollow">alias</a> returned by <code>choose folder</code> to an <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/applescript/conceptual/applescriptlangguide/conceptual/ASLR_fundamentals.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH218-SW7" rel="nofollow">object specifier</a>:</p>

<pre><code>set originFolder to folder (choose folder)
</code></pre>

<p>The loop that moves the items will terminate with an index out of bounds error because the number of items in the <code>originFolder</code> changes upon each iteration through the loop, as items are being moved.</p>

<p>A better solution is to first compute the indexes of the files that should be moved and then have the Finder perform the move operation in one step:</p>

<pre><code>tell application "Finder"
    set originFolder to folder (choose folder)
    set destFolder to folder (choose folder)
    set indexes to {}
    repeat with i from 4 to (count of items in originFolder) by 4
        copy i to end of indexes
    end repeat
    move (every item of originFolder whose index is in indexes) to destFolder
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>While casting raw memory into objects might work in practice, officially it invokes undefined behavior and as a result of that, according to the C++ standard, your code might do anything. </p>

<p>Placement new, OTOH, is a technique to invoke a constructor at a particular address, and construction is what officially turns raw memory into valid objects. That's why I would prefer placement new.<br>
Just to make sure, I would also have the destructor for such objects is called. While you say that you only need this for PODs and PODs' destruction is a no-op, many bugs I have seen in my carrier were in code that was written with a set of restrictions in mind, but had later some of the restrictions lifted and suddenly found itself in an environment with which it was unable to cope. </p>

<p>Also note that there might be platforms out there for which not all possible bit patterns a valid values even for a built-in type. Such platforms might also trap access to values of such pattern. For example, it could be that an all-zero bit pattern is not a valid value for a floating type, so even zeroing the memory before-hand could not prevent a hardware exception. </p>

<p>You need to use <code>-lopengl32</code> without "lib" and ".a"</p>
^^
<p>Hi all,i have a gridview that shows some indicators.one of the numbers is a computed percentage it looks like this "33.33333333333333333333333333333333333333" i tried to set the DataFormatString property of the column to several different formats such as "{0:P}" ,"{0:D}" and "{0:##.##}" but nothing worked for me to show it like that "33.34". Any ideas?</p>
^^
<p>The -l flag automatically adds the lib prefix and the .a extension- you want:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -LC:/mingw/lib main.o -o test.exe -lopengl32
</code></pre>

<p>Note you don't need the quotes around the path either. You could also just specify the whole library name &amp; path:</p>

<pre><code>g++  main.o -o test.exe C:/mingw/lib/libopengl32.a
</code></pre>

<p>I believe the primary reason mergesort was chosen is because it is stable.</p>

<p>The n log n worst-case guarantee that others have mentioned is an advantage, but it is likely not the primary reason.  If you look at the <code>Arrays.sort</code> methods, all the sorts on primitives use quicksort, and the sorts on <code>Object[]</code> use mergesort.  This is because stable sort does not matter for primitives; equal primitives are not distinguishable from each other.</p>

<p>Depending on the chosen filter, I'd like the OpenDialog to 'look' in different directries.
Something like:</p>

var
  Dialog: TOpenDialog;
  FilterIndex: Integer;
  FilterExt: string;

  Dialog := Sender as TOpenDialog;
  FilterIndex := Dialog.FilterIndex;
  FilterExt := ExtFromFilter(Dialog.Filter, FilterIndex);
  GetIniPathForExtension(FilterExt, Path);
  if DirectoryExists(Path) and
     (Path &lt;&gt; IncludeTrailingPathDelimiter(Dialog.InitialDir)) then
  begin
    // those two statements don't have the desired effect
    // but illustrate what is meant to happen:
    Dialog.FileName := Path + '*' + FilterExt;
    Dialog.InitialDir := Path;
  end;
end;  { TForm1.actFileOpenOpenDialogTypeChange }
</code></pre>

<p>I can't find any way to let the dialog update itself to the new directory.
I've tried calling OpenDialog.Execute, but that starts another OpenDialog without closing the current one...</p>

<p>I'm having a really big problem with live binding in jQuery 1.4. I want to bind a hover event to the div.message elements and fade in the controls. They are hidden by default. This is easy when using <code>.hover()</code>, but doesn't bind new items that are added via ajax. I've tried <code>.live()</code> with no success. It fires the <code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code> events every time the cursor moves over the various contents of the messages. As you can imagine this makes the controls flicker. I want the the controls to fade in when the mouse is over the message. But I need to bind the effect to new messages as they are loaded. I am apposed to binding hover events as messages are loaded. I would prefer a solution like live, but works exactly like hover. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="messages"&gt;
    &lt;div class="message"&gt;
        &lt;div class="controls"&gt;
            &lt;a href="dosomthing"&gt;
                do somthing
            &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a href="dosomthing"&gt;
                do somthing
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="message"&gt;
        &lt;div class="controls"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="message"&gt;

<p>Your rewrites should be working correctly, but WordPress doesn't see your modifications. The reason for this is that WordPress reads from <code>$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']</code>, which will always contain the <em>original</em> request URI, instead of the resulting one from the <code>mod_rewrite</code> operations.</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with actually using WordPress, but I have looked at some of the source code for some other questions, and it seems it will also attempt to use <code>$_SERVER['PATH_INFO']</code>, if it's provided. Consequently, you can try this:</p>

<pre><code>AcceptPathInfo On
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

RewriteRule ^fastigheter-(spanien|usa)/([^\./]+)$ property/$2&amp;lang=sv
RewriteRule ^properties-(spain|usa)/([^\./]+)$    property/$2&amp;lang=en

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule .* /index.php/$0 [L]
</code></pre>

<p>I find that using <code>PATH_INFO</code> is problematic though (and typically won't work in a per-directory context, although I don't think that I've determined why yet), and generally recommend against it.</p>

<p>Your other option involves working a bit on the PHP side as well. You can do something similar to what <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3378761/wordpress-custom-rewrite-rules-htaccess-or-functions-php/3379441#3379441">Anraiki suggested</a>, or you can just tell <code>$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']</code> to be what you're expecting.</p>

<p>If <code>mod_rewrite</code> performs a redirection, the <code>REQUEST_URI</code> as the module sees it is stored in the server's <code>REDIRECT_URL</code> variable. So, adjusting the rewrite ruleset a bit, we can do this:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# Force L on these rules to cause the REQUEST_URI to be changed (so that
# REDIRECT_URL will end up with the rewritten value we want)
RewriteRule ^fastigheter-(spanien|usa)/([^\./]+)$ property/$2&amp;lang=sv [L]
RewriteRule ^properties-(spain|usa)/([^\./]+)$    property/$2&amp;lang=en [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</code></pre>

<p>Then, somewhere early on in the WordPress processing (such as in <code>index.php</code>, since you shouldn't likely need to update that file with subsequent WordPress releases), you could do the following:</p>

<pre><code>if (!empty($_SERVER['REDIRECT_URL']))
    $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = $_SERVER['REDIRECT_URL'];
</code></pre>

<p>There may very well be a way to define your behaviour in WordPress using the permalink settings themselves, since it does iterate over that rule list in parsing the request, but I'm not entirely clear on the details of this as I've never used it myself. If this is possible, I would consider it the recommended way of handling this situation, but either way hopefully one of these options should get things working for you.</p>

<p>What happens if you use "{0:F2}"?</p>
^^
<p>To workaround that, you can use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/delegate/" rel="nofollow"><code>delegate</code></a> added in version <strong><em>1.4.2</em></strong> instead like this:</p>

<pre><code>$("#container").delegate("div", "hover", function(){
    // your code....
});
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>.delegate()</p>
  
  <p>Description: Attach a handler to one
  or more events for all elements that
  match the selector, <strong>now or in the
  future</strong>, based on a specific set of
  root elements.</p>

<p>My <em>initial</em> idea would be to set up a 15x3 matrix of resizable images. The leftmost and righmost of the 15 would be the inner and outer table sides of the boards and the central one would be the bar.</p>

<p>The three-high dimension would be the middle of the board (no image) with the triangular images when the pieces are placed at top and bottom.</p>

<p>Then I would see how that worked out with resizing. If no good, change it.</p>

<p>I'd make these all the same size except possibly the outer table edge since you don't need to put any pieces there.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>space to show the dice throws and doubling cube.</li>
<li>a way to offset the pieces slightly if you end up with six or more at one point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps a good move would be to fire up the Windows backgammon game and see how it does it.</p>

<p>I use a <code>struct</code> whenever I need an aggregate of <code>public</code> of public data members (as opposed to <code>class</code>, which I use for types that come with a certain level of abstractions and have their data <code>private</code>). </p>

<p>Whether or not such a data aggregate has member functions doesn't matter to me. In fact, I rarely ever write a <code>struct</code> without also providing at least one constructor for it. </p>

<p>Apps can receive and respond to location events in the background in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Applications can register for significant location changes only (your app runs in the background when a significant change in location occurs).</li>

<p>Because its easy! From Java 1.1 to Java 1.4 just tiny language features were introduced (<code>strictfp</code> for example). So why restrict yourself if you don't need to. So lets say you write a <code>StringUtil</code> class or you parse Word files then is simply does't matter. Just starting with Java 5 you have language improvement and from Java 1.0 to Java 1.1 of course inner classes.</p>

<p>This is just for the language and not so much for the libraries. There are interesting additions of course.</p>

<p>If I understand your question right, you are asking whether you can <em>execute JavaScript code</em> from C#, and then pass the result (which in your example would be a JavaScript Array object) into C# code.</p>

<p>The answer is: Of course it’s theoretically possible, but you would need to have an actual JavaScript interpreter to execute the JavaScript. You’ll have to find one or write your own, but given that JavaScript is a full-blown programming language, and writing interpreters for such a large and full-featured programming language is quite an undertaking, I suspect that you won’t find a complete ready-made solution, nor will you be able to write one unless your dedication exceeds that of all other die-hard C#-and-JavaScript fans worldwide.</p>

<p>However, with a bit of trickery, you <em>might</em> be able to coerce an existing JavaScript interpreter to do what you want. For obvious reasons, all browsers have such an interpreter, including Internet Explorer, which you can access using the WinForms WebBrowser control. Thus, you could try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have your C# code generate an HTML file containing the JavaScript you downloaded plus some JavaScript that turns it into JSON (you appear to have already found something that does this) and outputs it in the browser.</li>
<li>Open that HTML file in the WebBrowser control, have it execute the JavaScript, and then read the contents of the website back, now that it contains the result of the executed JavaScript.</li>
<li>Turn the JSON into a C# array using <code>DataContractJsonSerializer</code> as you suggested.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a pretty roundabout way to do it, but it is the best I can think of.</p>

<p>I have to wonder, though, why you are retrieving a JavaScript file from the web in the first place. What generates this JavaScript file? Whatever generates it, surely could generate some properly readable stuff instead (e.g. an XML file)? If it is not generated but written by humans, then why is it written in JavaScript instead of XML, CSV, or some other data format? Hopefully with these thoughts you might be able to find a solution that doesn’t require JavaScript trickery like the above.</p>

<p>Interfacing between the Winforms and OpenGL models of states and events can be very tricky get right.  My advice is to follow the structure of some other code that does this successfully.  A good choice would be the implementation of SimpleOpenGLControl in the Tao Framework.    </p>

<p>This is not very idiomatic and I would like to change it to something that happens within the try...catch clause.<br>
Is there a way to not violate DRY and still stay within the idioms the language offers?<br>
Of course I can inherit from the SoapException and log it but I'll have to catch a SoapException and create a new exception object that wraps it and then throw it only to be silenced one level above.<br>
Any idea guys?</p>

<p>I had a look at the generated assembly for each of these techniques, using the following program:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;new&gt;

char blob[128];

int main() {
    void *pLocation = blob;
    char pattern = 'x';
#ifdef CAST
    *reinterpret_cast&lt;char*&gt;(pLocation) = pattern;
#else
    ::new(pLocation) char(pattern);
#endif
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using g++ 4.4.3 on Linux 64-bits with default compiler flags.</p>

<p>The relevant part of the asm for <strong>placement new</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>    movb    $120, -1(%rbp)
    movq    -16(%rbp), %rax
    movq    %rax, %rsi
    movl    $1, %edi
    call    _ZnwmPv
    movq    %rax, %rdx
    testq   %rdx, %rdx
    je  .L5
    movzbl  -1(%rbp), %edx
    movb    %dl, (%rax)
.L5:
</code></pre>

<p>From what I gather, this actually calls the placement new operator, and checks its return value, even though it always succeeds. It then proceeds to write the value of <code>x</code> into the returned memory.</p>

<p>And for the <strong><code>reinterpret_cast</code></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>    movb    $120, -1(%rbp)
    movq    -16(%rbp), %rax
    movzbl  -1(%rbp), %edx
    movb    %dl, (%rax)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that these instructions are identical to the first two and the last two of the placement <code>new</code> version.</p>

<p>Using <code>-O1</code>, both pieces of code generate <em>identical</em> assembly:</p>

<pre><code>movb    $120, blob(%rip)
</code></pre>

<p>So, if you're worried about performance, don't be. Any other sane compiler will probably reduce both to the same code as well.</p>
^^
<p>I think the most common reason is, that new features introduced in later versions are not used anyway. I mean, if a library does not use new features like generics or advanced concurrency features, there is no compatibility overhead at all.</p>

<p>Assuming you get a network stream you could do something like the code below.</p>

<p>The <code>Main()</code> sub gets a network stream and reads it until the end. It passed the bytes over to the <code>PlayBuffer</code> class which appends the bytes to the end of a MemoryStream. When you use the <code>Read()</code> method on the <code>PlayBuffer</code>, it reads from the start and keeps a pointer to where you have read to. The locking is there so that you can write and read to the stream from separate threads. I have not provided code which uses Read(). It's just to give an idea. If you are getting continous bytes, then you could allocate a large buffer and once at the end, you start writing at the beginning again (ring-buffer).</p>

<p><strong>[Edit - modified code to write and read at the same time]</strong></p>

<p>I have not completely tested the code, but the PlayBuffer class inherits a stream and should be able to write and read at the same time, as long as one thread writes and the other just reads.</p>

<p>I'm currently discovering scala and I was wondering if I could use traits with a factory.</p>

<p>I tried this :</p>

<pre>
abstract class Foo {
  ...
}
object Foo {
  def apply() = new Bar

  private class Bar extends Foo {
    ...
  }
}

Foo() with MyTrait // Not working

<p>I guess it's because <code>with</code> must be preceded by <code>new</code>.</p>

<p>So is there any way to do this ?</p>

<p>it is possible to protect a .swf file from decompilation?</p>

<p>i've been reading about compiling class libraries in a .swc file for distribution without revealing the code - possibly selling it.  however, there are .swf decompilers you can use to expose the code, and a .swc file is simply a .zip archive, so changing myswc.swc to myswc.zip will reveal the .swf files of the library.</p>

<p>just curious, mostly.</p>

<p>I really enjoy the JDBC abstraction in Java. I don't care what database type I am connecting to, or what driver is being used. That's all set up in the DataSource object, and once it's done, we just use connections. It's such a consistent API in order to commit/rollback, perform transactions, and you only need to learn it once, and move on with your life. MySQL/Oracle - no worries, it's all the same (except for the SQL differences)</p>

<p>Four questions:
1. What is the most popular equivalent for c++/c.
2. What is the best?
3. Is there any api that mirrors the java api for connections? Something very similar?
4. I really like the Dao/DaoImpl pattern often employed in Java. Do people do this same pattern in c++. </p>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I can think of one approach to do that:</p>

<p>1) Check where the form submits to. Normally, form have an action tag indicating the url to which the form info is sent.</p>

<p>2) Check the http method.</p>

<p>3) Collect the names of the input fields in the form. Your variables in asp.net have to be named with the same names.</p>

<p>4) Create a manual web request to this url using this method and attach all the variables you need to send.</p>

<p>Some example code:</p>

<pre><code>HttpWebRequest request = HttpWebRequest.Create("yourFormUrl");
request.Method = "POST"

<p>It is because integer arithmetic always wraps it's result except for the case of (Division/Remainder By Zero).<br>
In case of float, when there is an overflow or underflow, the wrapping goes to 0, infinity or NaN.<br>
During the overflow, it gives infinity and during underflow, it gives 0.<br>
Again there are positive &amp; negative overflow/underflow.<br>
Try:</p>

<pre><code>float a = -1000;
float b = a/0;
System.out.println("b=" +b);
</code></pre>

<p>This gives a negative overflow
<br><br>Output</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>b=-Infinity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly positive underflow will result in 0 and negative underflow in -0.<br>
Certain operations can also result in returning a NaN(Not a Number) by float/double.<br>
For eg:<br></p>

<pre><code>float a = -1000;
double b = Math.sqrt(a);
System.out.println("b=" +b);
</code></pre>

<p>Output<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>b=NaN</p>

<p>Firstly get a copy of TCPView from the <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com" rel="nofollow">Sysinternals</a> suite (now run by Microsoft) and use it to monitor which app is using the port you want to use.</p>

<p>I would hazard a guess that if the app works fine as a stand alone (as you say it does) and you are trying to use the same port in the service then perhaps the service app is opening up the port at startup without you realizing it and then when you try to open the port manually the app finds it already in use. Or somehow the app is trying to open the port twice. The first time is successful but, maybe due to an event or an unexpected code path, the app tries to open it a second time and fails. TCPView will help spot this.</p>

else if ($country = 'Urugway') { $id = 'urugway_type'; }

<p>I have a particular problem with config files and deployment. When I deploy my project, it eventually moves to two different branches: staging and production (using SVN here)</p>

<p>I make the branch from my local working copy of the project. What this ends up doing is overwriting staging and development's copy of the config files, so I manually have to go in and make the correct changes every time I deploy.</p>

<p>Does it make sense to delete the config files from SVN completely since it's set in stone? Or is there another way in doing this?</p>
^^
<p>To be honest, your question isn't particularly clear - it's not obvious why you've got the <code>lineCount</code>, or what <code>deleteDuplicates</code> will do, or why you've named the <code>line</code> variable that way when it's not actually a line - it's a map from lines to the last line number on which that line appeared.</p>

<p>Unless you need the line numbers, I'd use a <code>Set&lt;String&gt;</code> instead.</p>

<p>However, all that aside, if you look at the <code>keySet</code> of <code>line</code> afterwards, it <em>will</em> be all the lines. That's assuming that the text file is genuinely in the default encoding for your system (which is what <code>FileReader</code> uses, unfortunately - I generally use <code>InputStreamReader</code> and specify the encoding explicitly).</p>

<p>If you could give us a short but <em>complete</em> program, the text file you're using as input, the expected output and the actual output, that would be helpful.</p>

I'm packaging some software and pushing and pulling on the repository, I'm run out of space. Now I need to clean (the packages are note needed anymore).
How can I delete these packages from the remote repository history, considering that I cannot re-create the repository (it's too strictly linked to RedMine)?</p>
^^
<p>Some time ago I have looked after exactly that sort of thing, but couldn't find a solution either. Nowadays I'm glad not to implement it anyway for the following reason:</p>

<p><em>Imagine a user executes the open dialog. He knows where to find the required file and navigates to that folder. Now he can't see the file and realizes that the filter is set wrong. He changes the filter and naturally expects the folder to stay the same.</em></p>

<p>Try and make some observations: in most of the cases a user first selects the folder and after that the file type.</p>
^^
<p>Conversion method:</p>

<pre><code>public Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; ToPropertyDictionary(User theUser)
{
  Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; result = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
  result.Add("Name", theUser.Name);
  result.Add("LastName", theUser.Name);
  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Called by:</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;&gt; x =
  from u in Users.AsEnumerable()  //ensure local execution by using AsEnumerable
  select ToPropertyDictionary(u);
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to everything else, I would highly recommend the <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201752840" rel="nofollow">Database Design for Mere Mortals</a> book by Michael Hernandez. It's very well written, touches on all the important points, works out the good and bad of database design, and is very useful overall.</p>

<p>It's not SQL Server specific, but all the concepts and ideas put forward here absolutely apply to anyone doing any serious work in SQL Server.</p>

<p>Once you've designed and set up your database, you might need to query it :-) and then I'd recommend the companion book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321444434" rel="nofollow">SQL Queries for Mere Mortals</a> which covers the querying techniques - what are the various JOIN types, what do they do, etc.</p>

<p>i ended up taking the width of the container div and manually spacing each element in it.</p>

<pre><code>    function alignHand(){
            var cards = $(".inHand");
            var totalWidth = 0;
            var width = $('#hand').width() - 140;
            cards.each(function(e){
                    totalWidth = totalWidth + 1;
                    $(this).addClass('cardInHand' + totalWidth);
                    $(this).css('position','absolute');
                    $(this).css('left',width/cards.length * (totalWidth - 1) + 'px');

            });

<p>Use <code>switch</code> control structure . It will make your code shorter.</p>

<p>The standard for cross platform database connectivity is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity" rel="nofollow">ODBC</a>. However, this is a very large C API which can take some getting used to (but works well once you are used to it). There are  a lot of C++ wrapper libraries for it, but I can't recommend any of them as I've always used my own wrapper. Do a search for "c++ database library" using the SO google search at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search">http://stackoverflow.com/search</a> to see lots of questions on this topic.</p>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>looking at your example you could do something like</p>

<pre><code>$id = strtolower($country) + '_type';
</code></pre>
^^
<p>Hello, I'd like to ask how could I load textures from program resources.</p>

<p>This code works fine, but its only from file. How about loading from resources?</p>

<pre><code>texture = TextureLoader.FromFile(device, "file.png");
</code></pre>
^^
<p>You could just create <code>$id</code> from <code>$country</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$id = strtolower($country) . '_type';
</code></pre>

<p>If you first need to determine the validity of <code>$country</code>, put all your countries in an array, then use <a href="http://uk.php.net/manual/en/function.in-array.php" rel="nofollow"><code>in_array</code></a> to determine if <code>$country</code> is valid:</p>

<pre><code>$countries = array('USA', 'France', 'Germany', 'Spain', 'Uruguay');
if (in_array($country, $countries)) {
    $id = strtolower($country) . '_type';
}
</code></pre>

<p>hi,</p>

<p>I'm using a forum with several topics and node comments module to add comment nodes to the topics.</p>

<p>I'm importing an external database and adding the relationships directly in mysql to the node_comments table.</p>

<p>However before to see the comments of a quesition I need to add a random comment in drupal to this question. Which is probably triggering a function and getting new values from the table.</p>

<p>Is there a way to simulate this, I cannot add a comment and delete it for all thousands nodes in my Drupal ?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You can use bunch update in first place:</p>

<pre><code>Many.objects.filter(one=one).update(one=None)
</code></pre>

<p>I think that Django deletes related object on program level (without on delete cascade in DBMS). So probably your objects are in some kind of cache and Django still thinks that they are related to <code>one</code> object.</p>

<p>Try to list related objects before you delete.</p>

<pre><code>print one.many_set
one.delete()
</code></pre>

<p>If you still have any objects in this set you probably should fetch <code>one</code> from DB again, and then delete. Or you can use bunch delete:</p>

<pre><code>One.objects.filter(&lt;cryteria&gt;).delete()
</code></pre>
^^
<p>Place all countries and codes in array like this:</p>

<pre><code>$countries = array( "0" =&gt; array("country_name" =&gt; "usa", 
                                 "country_type" =&gt; "001" ) ,

                    "1" =&gt; array("country_name" =&gt; "uae", 
                                 "country_type" =&gt; "002" ),

                    -----------------------------
                    -----------------------------

                  );
</code></pre>

<p>Then use loop to compare country name and then get country id.</p>

<pre><code>$country = "usa";

for( $i = 0; $i &lt; count($countries); $i++ ) {
   if( $country == $countries[$i]["country_name"] ){
      $id = $countries[$i]["country_type"];
      break;
   }
}

echo $id;
</code></pre>
