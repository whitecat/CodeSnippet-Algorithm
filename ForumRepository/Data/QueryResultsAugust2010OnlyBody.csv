<p>I am using the async version of Google Analytics along with custom variables and events. I have placed the tracking script (cut and paste from google) at the end of the  section. </p>

<p>The custom variable is set above the tracking code in the head section. I'm assuming that Googles Analytics will send the data including the custom variable on page load. What happens if I have onclick triggered events? Will the custom variable in the head section get sent along with each event that is triggered as well?</p>

<p>I'm not sure how this plays out with javascript.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I ended up not subclassing UIWebView and using a Gesture Recognizer on the object in the view controller. It works really well!</p>

<p>im trying to index a folder that has some 2k pdf files. But it's not indexing 6 files. i copied those 6 and created a new catalog. it indexes. </p>

<p>what could be wrong. i tried emptying the catalog and reindex it. still it's not indexing all files. </p>

<p>Pls help. this is windows server 2008.</p>

<p>I'm trying to build a "simple" web app that calculates either a male or females body fat % based on the U.S. Navy's circumference formula.  I have the majority of the app completed at this point.  However, I cannot figure out why the way I've setup the formula below won't work.  Two of the values are underlined in red in my .cs file.</p>

<p><strong>My Formula:</strong></p>

<pre><code>TBBodyFat.Text = Convert.ToString(495 / (1.0324-.19077(Math.Log(Convert.ToDouble(TBWaist.Text)-Convert.ToDouble(TBNeck.Text)))+.15456(Math.Log(Convert.ToDouble(TBHeight.Text)))));  
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Original Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>%Fat=495/(1.0324-.19077(log(abdomen-neck))+.15456(log(height)))-450       
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Pop-Up for the two underlined values (.19077 and .15456):</strong></p>

<pre>

<p>When I save an apartment record in rails, for some reason it is updating the updated_on field <em>and</em> the created_on field. I can't figure out how/why the created_on field is being updated.</p>

<p>To try and debug the situation, I opened up a console window and did the following</p>

<pre><code>t = Apartment.find(11619)
t.beds = 4
t.save
</code></pre>

<p>When I check my log file, I see the following</p>

<pre><code>   SQL (0.0ms)   BEGIN
   Apartment Load (0.0ms)   SELECT `apartments`.id FROM `apartments` WHERE (`apartments`.`unit_num` = BINARY '2005' AND `apartments`.building_id = 17755 AND `apartments`.id &lt;&gt; 11619) LIMIT 1
   Apartment Load (0.0ms)   SELECT * FROM `apartments` WHERE (`apartments`.`id` = 11619) 
   Apartment Update (0.0ms)   UPDATE `apartments` SET `beds` = 4.0, `updated_on` = '2010-07-31 19:54:10' WHERE `id` = 11619
   SQL (0.0ms)   COMMIT
</code></pre>

<p>This shows only the updated_on field being changed!</p>

<p>So I guess the question is, what could change my created_on value and yet not show up in the rails log file?</p>

<p>EDIT: I know the created_on field is changing because when I do a sql query to check, the value has been updated to be the same as the updated_on field. Also, I display the created_on value to my users, which is what brought this bug to my attention.</p>

<p>EDIT2: The table definition is as follows. I seemed to have solved my problem by changing the default value from "CURRENT_TIMESTAMP" to "0000-00-00 00:00:00", though I don't understand why this would make a difference?</p>

<p>"Stripping" the GIF of animation can be done by converting it to another format and then back again. PNG is a good candidate for this "other format", since it is non-lossy, unlike JPEG. Using PHPs GD functions, and outputting a PNG instead of a GIF:</p>

<pre><code>header('Content-type: image/png');
imagepng(imagecreatefromgif($file));
</code></pre>

<p>This might work (haven't tested) if PHP/GD doesn't support animated GIFs (I don't think it does); and it will output the image in GIF format, unlike the above snippet:</p>

<pre><code>header('Content-type: image/gif');
imagegif(imagecreatefromgif($file));
</code></pre>

<p>If that won't work, and output in GIF format is essential, this will:</p>

<pre><code>$img1 = imagecreatefromgif($file);
$size = getimagesize($img1);
$img2 = imagecreatetruecolor($size[0], $size[1]);
imagecopy($img2, $img1, 0, 0, 0, 0, $size[0], $size[1]);
header('Content-type: image/gif');
imagegif($img2);
</code></pre>

<p>Caveat lector: I've never done this. The following is a rough sketch of what I'd try.</p>

<p>You will need to use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/c-api/unicode.html#PyUnicode_AsUnicode" rel="nofollow">PyUnicode_AsUnicode</a> function and the next one, PyUnicode_GetSize. In declarations, where you currently have <code>char</code>, use <a href="http://docs.python.org/c-api/unicode.html#Py_UNICODE" rel="nofollow">Py_UNICODE</a> instead. Presumably with a narrow (UCS2) build you will copy the internal structure, converting surrogate pairs as you go. With a wide (UCS4) build you might operate directly on the internal structure.</p>

<pre><code>    TBBodyFat.Text = Convert.ToString(495 / (1.0324-.19077*
(Math.Log(Convert.ToDouble(TBWaist.Text)-Convert.ToDouble(TBNeck.Text)))+.15456*
(Math.Log(Convert.ToDouble(TBHeight.Text)))));

<p>C# (not any programming language I've yet encountered) does not take adjacency of numbers to mean multiplication!</p>

<p>Ok, I've been figuring this out since I originally asked the question, and I finally have a solution that does just what I want.  A bit of up front explanation is due, however.  IHttpHandler is a very basic interface:</p>

<pre><code>bool IsReusable { get; }
void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
</code></pre>

<p>There is no built in property for accessing the route data, and the route data also can't be found in the context or the request.  A <code>System.Web.UI.Page</code> object has a <code>RouteData</code> property , <code>ServiceRoute</code>s do all the work of interpreting your UriTemplates and passing the values to the correct method internally, and ASP.NET MVC provides its own way of accessing the route data.  Even if you had a <code>RouteBase</code> that (a) determined if the incoming url was a match for your route and (b) parsed the url to extract all of the individual values to be used from within your IHttpHandler, there's no easy way to pass that route data to your IHttpHandler.  If you want to keep your IHttpHandler "pure", so to speak, it takes responsibility for dealing with the url, and how to extract any values from it.  The RouteBase implementation in this case is only used to determine if your IHttpHandler should be used at all.</p>

<p>One problem remains, however.  Once the RouteBase determines that the incoming url is a match for your route, it passes off to an IRouteHandler, which creates the instances of the IHttpHandler you want to handle your request.  But, once you're in your IHttpHandler, the value of <code>context.Request.CurrentExecutionFilePath</code> is misleading.  It's the url that came from the client, minus the query string.  So it's not the path to your .ashx file.  And, any parts of your route that are constant (such as the name of the method) will be part of that execution file path value.  This can be a problem if you use UriTemplates within your IHttpHandler to determine which specific method within your IHttpHandler should handing the request.</p>

<p>Example:  If you had a .ashx handler at /myApp/services/myHelloWorldHandler.ashx
And you had this route that mapped to the handler: "services/hello/{name}"
And you navigated to this url, trying to call the <code>SayHello(string name)</code> method of your handler:
<a href="http://localhost/myApp/services/hello/SayHello/Sam" rel="nofollow">http://localhost/myApp/services/hello/SayHello/Sam</a></p>

<p>Then your <code>CurrentExecutionFilePath</code> would be: /myApp/services/hello/Sam.  It includes parts of the route url, which is a problem.  You want the execution file path to match your route url.  The below implementations of <code>RouteBase</code> and <code>IRouteHandler</code> deal with this problem.</p>

<p>Before I paste the 2 classes, here's a very simple usage example.  Note that these implementations of RouteBase and IRouteHandler will actually work for IHttpHandlers that don't even have a .ashx file, which is pretty convenient.</p>

<pre><code>// A "headless" IHttpHandler route (no .ashx file required)
RouteTable.Routes.Add(new GenericHandlerRoute&lt;HeadlessService&gt;("services/headless"));
</code></pre>

<p>That will cause all incoming urls that match the "services/headless" route to be handed off to a new instance of the <code>HeadlessService</code> IHttpHandler (HeadlessService is just an example in this case.  It would be whatever IHttpHandler implementation you wanted to pass off to).</p>

<p>Ok, so here are the routing class implementations, comments and all:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;

public class GenericHandlerRoute&lt;T&gt; : RouteBase where T : IHttpHandler, new()
{
    public string RouteUrl { get; set; }


    public GenericHandlerRoute(string routeUrl)
    {
        RouteUrl = routeUrl;
    }


    public override RouteData GetRouteData(HttpContextBase httpContext)
    {
        // See if the current request matches this route's url
        string baseUrl = httpContext.Request.CurrentExecutionFilePath;
        int ix = baseUrl.IndexOf(RouteUrl);
        if (ix == -1)
            // Doesn't match this route.  Returning null indicates to the asp.net runtime that this route doesn't apply for the current request.
            return null;

        baseUrl = baseUrl.Substring(0, ix + RouteUrl.Length);

        // This is kind of a hack.  There's no way to access the route data (or even the route url) from an IHttpHandler (which has a very basic interface).
        // We need to store the "base" url somewhere, including parts of the route url that are constant, like maybe the name of a method, etc.
        // For instance, if the route url "myService/myMethod/{myArg}", and the request url were "http://localhost/myApp/myService/myMethod/argValue",
        // the "current execution path" would include the "myServer/myMethod" as part of the url, which is incorrect (and it will prevent your UriTemplates from matching).
        // Since at this point in the exectuion, we know the route url, we can calculate the true base url (excluding all parts of the route url).
        // This means that any IHttpHandlers that use this routing mechanism will have to look for the "__baseUrl" item in the HttpContext.Current.Items bag.
        // TODO: Another way to solve this would be to create a subclass of IHttpHandler that has a BaseUrl property that can be set, and only let this route handler
        // work with instances of the subclass.  Perhaps I can just have RestHttpHandler have that property.  My reticence is that it would be nice to have a generic
        // route handler that works for any "plain ol" IHttpHandler (even though in this case, you have to use the "global" base url that's stored in HttpContext.Current.Items...)
        // Oh well.  At least this works for now.
        httpContext.Items["__baseUrl"] = baseUrl;

        GenericHandlerRouteHandler&lt;T&gt; routeHandler = new GenericHandlerRouteHandler&lt;T&gt;();
        RouteData rdata = new RouteData(this, routeHandler);

        return rdata;

    {
        // This route entry doesn't generate outbound Urls.

}

</code></pre>

<p>I know this answer has been quite long winded, but it was not an easy problem to solve.  The core logic was easy enough, the trick was to somehow make your IHttpHandler aware of the "base url", so that it could properly determine what parts of the url belong to the route, and what parts are actual arguments for the service call.</p>

<p>These classes will be used in my upcoming C# REST library, <a href="http://rest.codeplex.com" rel="nofollow">RestCake</a>.  I hope that my path down the routing rabbit hole will help anyone else who decides to RouteBase, and do cool stuff with IHttpHandlers.</p>

<p>So, I want to have an image resized to 30% of its original height/width. Pretend you don't know its height or width, how would you go about it using only CSS/HTML?</p>

<p>Well you need to use "*" for multiplication. <strike>Plus I'm not sure whether C# allows ".123" style numeric literals without leading 0.</strike></p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code> TBBodyFat.Text =
      Convert.ToString(495/
         (1.0324-0.19077*(Math.Log(Convert.ToDouble(TBWaist.Text)-Convert.ToDouble(TBNeck.Text)))+0.15456*(Math.Log(Convert.ToDouble(TBHeight.Text)))));

<p>In an C program, I need to re-initialize all global variables as they where when the program starts for tests purpose.</p>

<p>I want to reproduce the data copy from Load Memory Address, LMA to VMA (run-time address) done by GCC libraries with a reinitialization function.
For example, if foo variables are declared as global and initialized. And if my re-initialization function is re_init():</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 
int foo1 = 42;
int foo2 = 777;

int main(){
    foo1 = 0;
    foo2 = 0;
    re_init();
    printf("foo1:%d and foo2:%d",foo1,foo2);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then I want to have as an output :</p>

<pre><code>foo1:42 and foo2:777
</code></pre>

<p>I believe that the right way to do this is to the default linker file and maybe the startup code that copy initiation values to RAM.
So, with GCC (cygwin), what should I do to achieve this?</p>

<p>I'm using PHPDesigner but I will go for Eclipse PDT. I was always against Eclipse until few months ago when I have one Java project to finish... Great IDE</p>

<p>Now I can't imagine one day without Eclipse. :)</p>

<p>I have a layout that creates a ListActivity. Before displaying the ListActivity, I perform a database query, and then hook that data up to the List using a SimpleCursorAdapter.</p>

<p>All of this works fine on 1.6 and higher. On 1.5, the my function that performs the query successfully executes, but then a few seconds later a StackOverflowError takes place. Does anyone know why this error would occur in 1.5 but not in 1.6?</p>

<p>UPDATE: I have determined that the crash occurs when I move from an Activity with a TabView to an Activity with the ListView. If I go to the ListView from an Activity that does not contain a Tab View, then the crash does not occur. The activity with the ListView is returning a Cursor to a query where the database has about 10 columns. Of those 10 columns, I display 3 columns on the screen.</p>

<p>Here is the flow of execution for my code:</p>

<pre><code>TabView Activity sends Intent to start List View Activity

onCreate() //of ListActivity
{
    showList();
}

showList()
{
    //open DataBase
    //perform query
    //create SimpleCursorAdapter
    //setListAdapter
}
</code></pre>

<p>So for example, this runs completely fine on a Droid with 2.1 installed and on an emulator targeting 1.6. But the above fails on the HTC Hero with 1.5 and on an emulator targeting 1.5.</p>

<p>The crash happens if I let setListAdapter execute. If that line is out, everything works, but obviously my data does not get shown. It doesn't crash on the line that calls setListAdapter, but it'll eventually crash if setListAdapter is ever executed.</p>

<p>Stack Trace:</p>

<p>Let's say I have a list of IDs and I want to see if rows already exist with those IDs in my SQL database. Is there a single SQL command that I can issue to get back the subset of the ID list that's not already represented in the database? I could iterate over each ID in my code and issue a separate SQL check for each ID, but that sounds inefficient.</p>

<p>I'm trying to do this against an sqlite database. thanks! </p>

<p>I'm building an ASP.NET MVC 2 site that uses LINQ to SQL. In one of the places where my site accesses the DB, I think a race condition is possible.</p>

<hr>

<h2>DB Architecture</h2>

<p>Here are some of the columns of the relevant DB table, named <code>Revisions</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>RevisionID</em> - bigint, IDENTITY, PK</li>
<li><em>PostID</em> - bigint, FK to PK of <code>Posts</code> table</li>
<li><em>EditNumber</em> - int</li>
<li><em>RevisionText</em> - nvarchar(max)</li>
</ul>

<p>On my site, users can submit a Post and edit a Post later on.  Users other than the original poster are able to edit a Post - so there is scope for multiple edits on a single Post simultaneously.</p>

<p>When submitting a Post, a record in the <code>Posts</code> table is created, as well as a record in the <code>Revisions</code> table with <em>PostID</em> set to the ID of the <code>Posts</code> record, <em>RevisionText</em> set to the Post text, and <em>EditNumber</em>  set to 1.</p>

<p>When editing a Post, only a <code>Revisions</code> record is created, <strong>with <em>EditNumber</em> being set to 1 higher than the latest edit number</strong>.</p>

<p>Thus, the <em>EditNumber</em> column refers to how many times a Post has been edited.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Incrementing <em>EditNumber</em></h2>

<p>The challenge that I see in implementing those functions is incrementing the <em>EditNumber</em> column. As that column can't be an <em>IDENTITY</em>, I have to manipulate its value manually.</p>

<p>Here's my LINQ query for determining what <em>EditNumber</em> a new Revision should have:</p>

<pre><code>using(var db = new DBDataContext())
{
    var rev = new Revision();
    rev.EditNumber = db.Revisions.Where(r =&gt; r.PostID == postID).Max(r =&gt; r.EditNumber) + 1;

    // ... (fill other properties)

    db.Revisions.InsertOnSubmit(rev);
    db.SubmitChanges();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Calculating a maximum and incrementing it can lead to a race condition</strong>.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to implement that function?</p>

<p>Consider using a base class:</p>

<pre><code>class NoncopyableBase
{
public:
    NoncopyableBase() { }
    virtual ~NoncopyableBase() { }
private:
    NoncopyableBase(const NoncopyableBase&amp;);
    void operator=(const NoncopyableBase&amp;);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Any class derived from this base class will be noncopyable and will have a virtual destructor.</p>

<p>Drop the IDs into a table and then try:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT C.id
FROM checkids C
LEFT JOIN mytable M
ON M.id = C.id
WHERE M.id IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>After looking over the code over TeamViewer, and finally downloading, compiling and running the code on my own machine, I <strong>believe</strong> this is a case of <strong>compiler error in C# 4.0</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've posted a question with request for verification, after managing to reduce the problem to a few simple projects and files. It is available here: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3382231/possible-c-4-0-compiler-error-can-others-verify">Possible C# 4.0 compiler error, can others verify?</a></p>

<hr>

<p>The likely culprit is not this method:</p>

<pre><code>protected override List&lt;FeatureModel&gt; GetModels() {
    var fs = new FeatureService();
    var all = fs.FindAll();
    var wr = new WeakReference(all);
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(all != null, "FindAll must not return null");
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(wr.IsAlive);
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(all.ToString()); // throws NullReferenceException
    return all;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But the method it calls, FeatureService.FindAll:</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;FeatureModel&gt; FindAll() {
    string key = Cache.GetQueryKey("FindAll");
    var value = Cache.Load&lt;List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;&gt;(key);
    if (value == null) {
        var query = Context.Features;
        value = query.ToList().Select(x =&gt; Map(x)).ToList();
        var policy = Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy(value.Select(x =&gt; Cache.GetObjectKey(x.Id.ToString())), true);
        Cache.Store(key, value, policy);
    }
    value = new List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;();
    return value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I changed the call in GetModels from this:</p>

<pre><code>var all = fs.FindAll();
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code>var all = fs.FindAll().ToList(); // remember, it already returned a list
</code></pre>

<p>then the program crashes with a <code>ExecutionEngineException</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>After doing a clean, a build, and then looking at the compiled code through Reflector, here's how the output looks (scroll to the bottom of the code for the important part):</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;FeatureModel&gt; FindAll()
{
    List&lt;FeatureModel&gt; value;
    Func&lt;FeatureModel, string&gt; CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate6 = null;
    List&lt;FeatureModel&gt; CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate7 = null;
    string key = base.Cache.GetQueryKey("FindAll");
    if (base.Cache.Load&lt;List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;&gt;(key) == null)
    {
        if (CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate6 == null)
        {
            CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate6 = (Func&lt;FeatureModel, string&gt;) delegate (Feature x) {
                return this.Map(x);
            };
        }
        value = base.Context.Features.ToList&lt;Feature&gt;().Select&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt;(((Func&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt;) CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate6)).ToList&lt;FeatureModel&gt;();
        if (CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate7 == null)
        {
            CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate7 = (List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;) delegate (FeatureModel x) {
                return base.Cache.GetObjectKey(x.Id.ToString());
            };
        }
        Func&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt; policy = (Func&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt;) base.Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy(value.Select&lt;FeatureModel, string&gt;((Func&lt;FeatureModel, string&gt;) CS$&lt;&gt;9__CachedAnonymousMethodDelegate7), true);
        base.Cache.Store&lt;List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;&gt;(key, value, (CacheItemPolicy) policy);
    }
    value = new List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;();
    bool CS$1$0000 = (bool) value;
    return (List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;) CS$1$0000;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the 3 last lines of the method, here's what they look like in the code:</p>

<pre><code>value = new List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;();
return value;
</code></pre>

<p>here's what Reflector says:</p>

<pre><code>value = new List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;();
bool CS$1$0000 = (bool) value;
return (List&lt;FeatureModel&gt;) CS$1$0000;
</code></pre>

<p>It creates the list, then casts it to a boolean, then casts it back to a list and returns it. Most likely this causes a stack problem.</p>

<p>Here's the same method, in IL (still through Reflector), I've stripped away most of the code:</p>

<pre><code>.method public hidebysig instance class [mscorlib]System.Collections.Generic.List`1&lt;class FeatureCrowd.DomainModel.FeatureModel&gt; FindAll() cil managed

<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.screencast.com/users/lassevk/folders/Default/media/a1eeedfe-5dc6-4961-8f9b-0321e4c7b985" rel="nofollow">screencast showing the debug session</a>, if you just want the Reflector output, skip to about 2:50.</p>

<p>We have a situation with a fairly complex entity/table hierarchy modelled with EF4.  Often we like most of the associations to load (whether lazy or not) and are happy with that.</p>

<p>Sometimes we want just the top of the hierarchy and maybe one or two of the related detail tables to be attached.  For example when returning a set from a WCF method - as expected it will load every associated entity on the spot where often we just need a couple of them.</p>

<p>I know we can do this with projection but that seems to be a third slower than the regular query.  I think we can also "clear()" the detail entity sets we do not want but that also would be a performance hit.</p>

<p>It seems crazy we can't pull the entity as normal and just prevent lazy loading from ocurring, or prevent selected details from ever being attached.  I think I am missing a simple thing.</p>

<p>Your help is appreciated</p>

<p>Can anyone think of a better way of writing this out in a loop and getting the same result?</p>

<pre><code>$today = date('l');

    if($today == 'Wednesday'){
        $min = date('l-m-d-y');
        $max = date('l-m-d-y', strtotime('+4 days'));
    }else if($today == 'Thursday'){
        $min = date('l-m-d-y', strtotime('-1 days'));
        $max = date('l-m-d-y', strtotime('+3 days'));

<p>Is there a way to know which Intent Filter is responsible for launching an Activity which has two Intent Filters defined in AndroidManifest.xml? I want a slightly different set of logic, but not enough that should require a whole new Activity.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am building a social networking site in rails and I want to have a very simple messaging system. More or less just: inbox and set messages.  Lastly, I'd ideally like for it to function like facebook; in the users profile you click "send message to <em>username</em>" and it takes you to a compose screen.</p>

<p>The only rails messaging system I've come across at all is: <a href="http://www.novawave.net/public/rails_messaging_tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novawave.net/public/rails_messaging_tutorial.html</a> and it seem to be pretty buggy and not exactly what I want, nor is it very modern or DRY.</p>

<p>I think I might have to just create my own but I'm having a hard time visualizing exactly how it work work:</p>

<p>I'd want to have a Message model that has both a sender and a recipient (both linked to seperate user IDs)....now that I think about this, it doesn't seem like it would be very complicated at all.  Any suggestions or tips?</p>

<p>It depends on the scope of the custom variable. Page view scope will only send/report the first time.  You will have to include it in the onclick code that is triggered to get it to count each click.  </p>

<p>If you have it as a visit/session scope, in the reports, it will associate itself for each click event for the duration of the visit/session. </p>

<p>I have an iPhone application which is based on the "Window based application" template and which uses a main view with some embedded subviews.</p>

<p>For some action I need a confirmation by the user. Therefore, I create an UIActionSheet and ask the user for feedback.</p>

<p>The problem is, that the action sheet does not show at all. Instead, the screen gets darker. The sheet and the requested buttons do not show. After that, the application hangs. The darkening of the screen is a normal behavior as part of the animation which normally shows the action sheet.</p>

<p>Curiously, the same code works fine, if invoked in the viewDidLoad method. It does not work if invoked in the buttonPressed method which starts the action requiring the confirmation.</p>

<pre><code>- (void) trashButtonPressed {
   // This method is called in the button handler and (for testing
   // purposes) in the viewDidLoad method.
   NSLog( @"trashButtonPressed" );

   UIActionSheet* actionSheet =
        [[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitle: @"Test" 
                                    delegate: self 
                           cancelButtonTitle: @"Cancel"
                      destructiveButtonTitle: @"Delete Sheet"
                           otherButtonTitles: nil];

   [actionSheet showInView: self.view];
   [actionSheet release];
}

- (void)       willPresentActionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)  actionSheet {
   NSLog( @"willPresentActionSheet" );
}

- (void)       didPresentActionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)   actionSheet {
   NSLog( @"didPresentActionSheet" );
}

- (void)        actionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)actionSheet
  didDismissWithButtonIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex {
   NSLog( @"actionSheet:didDismissWithButtonIndex" );
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I have added some logging messages to the protocol handlers of the UIActionSheetDelegateProtocol. The "will present" and "did present" methods get called as expected, but the sheet does not show.</p>

<p>Does anybody know, what's wrong here?</p>

<p>I have a node which references other nodes. </p>

<p>If I give a user custom access to this node, how do I set it up so that he automatically gets access to those other nodes as well?</p>

<h1>Haskell</h1>

<p>I've started to learn Haskell recently - here's an attempt in that lesser known (but very nice) language.</p>

<pre><code>main=readLn&gt;&gt;=print.f 2
f a 1=[]
f a x=if x`mod`a==0 then show a:f a(x`div`a)else f(a+1)x
</code></pre>

<p>89 characters, but cheating really because again the output format isn't right. I tried to correct the output but couldn't get it less than 208 chars:</p>

<pre><code>import List
main=readLn&gt;&gt;=w
w n=putStrLn.foldl1(++).v n.map m.group.f 2$n
m a=' ':head a++j(length a)
v n=((s n++":"):)
s=show
j 1=[]
j n='^':s n
f a 1=[]
f a x=if x`mod`a==0 then s a:f a(x`div`a)else f(a+1)x
</code></pre>

<p>Any improvements welcomed. On a side note, I was amazed how much whitespace GHC lets you remove without complaining.</p>

<p>Check documentation of fopen(). And <a href="http://c-faq.com/stdio/feof.html" rel="nofollow">c-faq</a></p>

<p>Personally, I would remove the copy constructor declaration. You have pure virtual functions so instances of this class can't be created by slicing in any case. If a derived class isn't copyable because of the nature of a resource that it holds; it can mark itself as non-copyable.</p>

<p>Then I would get rid of the protected default constructor; it doesn't do anything and you have to derive from this class in any case as you have pure virtual functions so it's not preventing any usage.</p>

<p>Although marking the copy assignment operator prevents someone doing <code>*pBase1 = *pBase2</code> (effectively a no-op), personally I'm not convinced that it's worth the bother of trying to prevent it. As your class has no data members there's no inherent danger in the compiler generated one, it's really up to user to use pointers or references to base classes appropriately.</p>

<p>I would just go with:</p>

<pre><code>class Output
{
public:
    virtual ~Output() {}
    virtual void write( const std::vector&lt;char&gt; &amp;data ) = 0;
};
</code></pre>

<p>This applies to several cases in my application:</p>

<p>I have 3 or 4 functions that belong together, one is a starting function that creates and frees the required memory structures and calls the other functions as appropriate. The other functions also call themselves repeatedly. Only the starting functions is called from outside, and only once or not at all per application-run.</p>

<p>Currently, I pass pointers to the memory structures from the starting function as function arguments, but the argument list is getting quite long in some cases.</p>

<p>Is there any argument against creating classes for all these cases and making the pointers to the memory structures members?</p>

<p>I believe that the most important thing you must analyze is which kind of information do you want to extract. If you want to extract entire websites like google does probably your best option is to analyze tools like nutch from Apache.org or flaptor solution <a href="http://ww.hounder.org" rel="nofollow">http://ww.hounder.org</a> If you need to extract particular areas on unstructured data documents - websites, docs, pdf - probably you can extend nutch plugins to fit particular needs. nutch.apache.org</p>

<p>On the other hand if you need to extract particular text or clipping areas of a website where you set rules using DOM of the page probably what you need to check is more related to tools like mozenda.com. with those tools you will be able to set up extraction rules in order to scrap particular information on a website. You must take into consideration that any change on a webpage will give you an error on your robot.</p>

<p>Finally, If you are planning to develop a website using information sources you could purchase information from companies such as spinn3r.com were they sell particular niches of information ready to be consume. You will be able to save lots of money on infrastructure.
hope it helps!.

<p>Definitely go for a class here. That's what objects and classes are designed for.</p>

<p>A client appeared to have a similar problem.  I solved it by making hundreds of sessions rather than passing in hundreds of requests in one session.  Bloomberg may not be to happy with this BFI (brute force and ignorance) approach as we are sending the field requests for each session but it works.</p>

<p>Update directly in the database and return the new revision:</p>

<pre><code>update Revisions
set EditNumber += 1
output INSERTED.EditNumber
where PostID = @postId;
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not possible in LINQ. In fact, is not possible in the client <em>at all</em>, no matter the technology used, short of doing pessimistic locking which has too many drawback to worth considering.</p>

<p>Updated:</p>

<p>Here is how I would insert a new revision (including first revision):</p>

<pre><code>create procedure usp_insertPostRevision
  @postId int,
  @text nvarchar(max),
  @revisionId bigint output

as 
begin
  set nocount on;
  declare @nextEditNumber (EditNumber int not null);
  declare @rc int = 0;

  begin transaction;
  begin try
    update Posts
    set LastRevision += 1
    output INSERTED.LastRevision
       into @nextEditNumber (EditNumber)
    where PostId = @postId;

    set @rc = @@rowcount;

    if (@rc &lt;&gt; 1)
      raiserror (N'Expected exactly one post with Id:%i. Found:%i', 
        16, 1 , @postId, @rc);

    insert into Revisions
      (PostId, Text, EditNumber)
    select @postID, @text, EditNumber
    from @nextEditNumber;

    set @revisionId = scope_identity();

    commit;    
  end try
  begin catch
   ... // Error handling omitted
  end catch
end
</code></pre>

<p>I omitted the error handling, see <a href="http://rusanu.com/2009/06/11/exception-handling-and-nested-transactions/" rel="nofollow">Exception handling and nested transactions</a> for a template procedure than handles errors and nested transactions properly. </p>

<p>You'll notice the Posts table has a LastRevision field that is used as the increment for the post revisions. This is much better than computing the MAX each time you add a revision, as it avoid a (range) scan of Revisions. It also acts as a concurrency protection: only one transaction at a time will be able to update it, and only that transaction will proceed with inserting a new revision. Concurrent transactions will block and wait until the first one commits, then the next transaction unblocked will correctly update the revision number to +1.</p>

<p>It sounds to me like these functions belong in a class - with the internal functions private or protected - likewise with the members.</p>

<p>I just created my first Wordpress theme. I zipped it up and installed it on the server using the Wordpress 3.0.1 <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes#Adding_New_Themes_using_the_Administration_Panel" rel="nofollow">Administration Panel</a>. That worked fine. But now I've made a few changes to my theme and I want to update it. I couldn't find an "upgrade" option for uploaded themes so I tried just uploading it again. This is what I got.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Installing Theme from uploaded file:
  my-theme.zip</em></p>

<p>Is there any way to update the theme through the administration panel? Or do I have to access the filesystem somehow (FTP, etc.) and delete the directory first?</p>

<p>I want to post something to my database which consists of two tables which are linked with a foreign key.

How can I do that? Should I write two php files and how can I connect the two tables?</p>

<p>Here is a "developer-friendly" version of the "<strong>one query</strong>, <strong>no recursion</strong>" solution.</p>

<p><strong>SQL</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT id, parent_id, title, link, position FROM menu_item ORDER BY parent_id, position;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>PHP</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>$html = '';
$parent = 0;
$parent_stack = array();

// $items contains the results of the SQL query
$children = array();
foreach ( $items as $item )
    $children[$item['parent_id']][] = $item;

while ( ( $option = each( $children[$parent] ) || ( $parent &gt; 0 ) )
{
    if ( !empty( $option ) )
    {
        // 1) The item contains children:
        // store current parent in the stack, and update current parent
        if ( !empty( $children[$option['value']['id']] ) )
        {
            $html .= '&lt;li&gt;' . $option['value']['title'] . '&lt;/li&gt;';
            $html .= '&lt;ul&gt;'; 
            array_push( $parent_stack, $parent );
            $parent = $option['value']['id'];
        }
        // 2) The item does not contain children
        else
            $html .= '&lt;li&gt;' . $option['value']['title'] . '&lt;/li&gt;';
    }
    // 3) Current parent has no more children:
    // jump back to the previous menu level
    else
    {
        $html .= '&lt;/ul&gt;';
        $parent = array_pop( $parent_stack );
    }
}

// At this point, the HTML is already built
echo $html;
</code></pre>

<p>You just need to understand the usage of the $parent_stack variable.</p>

<p>It is a "LIFO" stack (Last In, First Out) - the image in the Wikipedia article worths a thousand words: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO_%28computing%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIFO_%28computing%29</a></p>

<p>When a menu option has sub-options, we store its parent ID in the stack:</p>

<pre><code>array_push( $parent_stack, $parent );
</code></pre>

<p>And then, we immediately update $parent, making it be the current menu option ID:</p>

<pre><code>$parent = $option['value']['id'];
</code></pre>

<p>After we looped all its sub-options, we can return back to the previous level:</p>

<pre><code>$parent = array_pop( $parent_stack );
</code></pre>

<p>This is why we stored the parent ID in the stack!</p>

<p>My suggestion is: contemplate the code snippet above, and understand it.</p>

<p>Questions are welcome!</p>

<p>One of the advantages I see in this approach is that it eliminates the risk of entering into an infinite loop, which can happen when recursion is used.</p>

<p>If I run this query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `Manga`.`id`, `Manga`.`name` FROM `mangas` AS `Manga` WHERE `Manga`.`id` in 
(
SELECT `manga_id` FROM `mangas_genres` where `manga_id` = 1
)
</code></pre>

<p>My computer does not respond (I just mistype). It can't run this query.
Is the above code invalid? Please, help me.</p>

<p>I think it is valid, but it can't run. I don't understand. It sure be MySQL, I run query on MYSQL workbench (not in PHP) my computer be very slower ( while run query) 
My table mangas and mangas_genres have more than 5000 rows.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I really like how uframe(http://www.codeproject.com/KB/aspnet/uframe.aspx) works but I can't find any documentation or example how I can control uframe div from the page which contains that uframe div.</p>

<p>Simply putted I want on my page, to change parameters in src of a uframe div, so I can get diffrent populated content.</p>

<p>For example, if my uframe looks like this:</p>



<p>I want from my page that contains that div to change id parameter and then to invoke uframe reload.</p>

<p>Anybody knows how to do this?</p>

<p>thanx</p>

<p>Say I have some context where variables are set and a λ-function is called which uses them directly:</p>

<pre><code>function outerContext(){
    ...
    var data = ...; // some data the script uses
    ...
    someObject.method = function(){
        data; // the variable is used here
        };
    ...
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I know that the dynamically created function has a snapshot of the context it was created in, so <code>data</code> variable is accessible there.</p>

<p>What are the dangers I may face with such an approach when I use this dynamically created method? Should I always give this <code>data</code> as an argument or is it ok?</p>

<p>Consider this snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
     &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span style="color:white;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How can you remove style from selected by user text?</p>

<p><hr />
<strong>Edited:</strong> to add clarifications from OP:</p>

<p>Thank you for your answers!
I had to be more precise. Sorry for that. 
What do I mean by "selected by user text": selected/highlighted with mouse.
I have many divs with spans inside(just like it is below-no extra ids,classes for spans:/).</p>

<pre><code>[...]
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:white;"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span style="color:white;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to achieve: user selects with mouse "ab", click button(input type=button) which remove style from selected span/spans. Similar behavior like it is in TinyMCE.</p>

<p>I am creating a mapping application that uses a WSGI service and needs a different config file for each map.  Currently, I launch the service with:</p>

<pre><code>import os, sys
tilecachepath = '/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/TileCache-2.10-py2.6.egg/TileCache'
sys.path.append(tilecachepath)
from TileCache.Service import Service, wsgiHandler
from paste.request import parse_formvars

theService = {}
def wsgiApp (environ, start_response):
    global theService
    fields = parse_formvars(environ)
    cfgs  = fields['cfg']
    theService = Service.load(cfgs)
    return wsgiHandler(environ, start_response, theService)

application = wsgiApp

</code></pre>

<p>This is obviously launching way too many handlers!  How can I determine if a specific handler is already running?  Is there anything in the apache config that I need to adjust so that handlers time out properly?</p>

<p>I'm writing some game at c++. The problem is with arrays. It always shows the 'desk' with points (empty parts). Need comments are in the code:</p>

<p>need an example on how to use a comparable class on a hashset to get an ascending order?
Let say we have a hashset like:
HashSet hs=new HashSet();
How can i get the hs to be in a ascending order??</p>

<p>Everything works fine on the first click of the delete link, but subsequent clicks only delete the record, without refreshing the "quotes" div.</p>

<p>I can't really think of any "dangers" besides the possibility of causing a circular reference and thus a memory leak in case of DOM objects or such.</p>

<p>It works much like a private variable in a class.</p>

<p>Can someone please explain me the following code snippet?</p>

<pre><code>value struct ValueStruct {
    int x;
};

void SetValueOne(ValueStruct% ref) {
    ref.x = 1;
}

void SetValueTwo(ValueStruct ref) {
    ref.x = 2;
}

void SetValueThree(ValueStruct^ ref) {
    ref-&gt;x = 3;
}

ValueStruct^ first = gcnew ValueStruct;
first-&gt;x = 0;
SetValueOne(*first);

ValueStruct second;
second.x = 0;
SetValueTwo(second); // am I creating a copy or what? is this copy Disposable even though value types don't have destructors?

ValueStruct^ third = gcnew ValueStruct;
third-&gt;x = 0;
SetValueThree(third); // same as the first ?
</code></pre>

<p>And my second question is: is there any reason to have something like that?:</p>

<pre><code>ref struct RefStruct {
    int x;
};

RefStruct% ref = *gcnew RefStruct;
// rather than:
// RefStruct^ ref = gcnew RefStruct;

// can I retrieve my handle from ref?
// RefStruct^ myref = ???
</code></pre>

<p>What is more: I see no difference between value type and ref type, since both can be pointed by handler ;(</p>

<p><code>==</code> is comparison, <code>=</code> is assignment.</p>

<p>Your line:</p>

<pre><code>someArray [x][y] == mark;
</code></pre>

<p>Does nothing.  It should be:</p>

<pre><code>someArray [x][y] = mark;

<p>Addendum: I would second @BalusC's point about implementing <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Comparable</code></a> and express

<p>Addendum: @Stephen raises an important point, which favors @BalusC's suggestion of <code>TreeMap</code>. <code>LinkedHashSet</code> is a more efficient alternative only if the data is (nearly) static and already sorted. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This class implements the Set

<p>You probably need to choose <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashSet.html" rel="nofollow">a different datastructure</a> if you want to  be able to control the iteration order (or indeed have one at all!)</p>

<p>You can get around that by making the static WndProc delegate everything to the members:</p>

std::map&lt;HWND, MyWindowClass *&gt; windowMap;

// Your class

  // The member WndProc
  LRESULT MyWndProc(UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) { /* ... */ }

public:
  MyWindowClass()
  {
    /* TODO: Create the window here and assign its handle to m_handle */
    /* Pass &amp;WndProc as the pointer to the Window procedure */

    // Register the window
    windowMap[m_handle] = this;
  }
};

// The delegating WndProc
LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hWnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
  std::map&lt;HWND, MyWindowClass *&gt;::iterator it = windowMap.find(hWnd);
  if (it != windowMap.end())
    return it-&gt;second-&gt;MyWndProc(message, wParam, lParam);
  return 0;
}

<p><code>someArray [x][y] == mark</code> tests the array to see if its equal to mark, but never actually sets it to anything...</p>

<p>The last 2 relative layouts are swappable and are aligned fine. Only one of them appear at a time and is changed on a button click. Anyway, The problem here is, I have to mention the layout_height of surface view in px or dp. If I give layout_height as  fill_parent, the view appears very small, 35% of width and height. Can anyone please give me a solution ?</p>

<p>The inner function does not have access to a "snapshot", it has full access to the <code>data</code> variable.</p>

<pre><code>function outer() {
    var data = 1;

    ...

    someObject.method = function () {
        data = 42;
    };

    someObject.method();
    // data == 42
}
</code></pre>

<p>(The real explanation being that when using <code>data</code> in the inner function, Javascript will try to figure out which scope <code>data</code> is in. It will traverse up the scope chain to find the place where the variable was created, and that's the variable that will be used.)</p>

<p>There's no "danger", this is one of the core competencies of Javascript. It's like an object method modifying an object's properties. Of course you need to take care what you want to do, do you really want to modify the variable or do you just want to use it locally?</p>

<p>For the "snapshot", you need to use a closure:</p>

<pre><code>function outer() {
    var data = 1;

    ...

    someObject.method = (function (data) {
        return function () {
            data = 42;
        }
    })(data);

    someObject.method();
    // data == 1
}

<p>Yes, relate them all within a class.</p>

<p>This will also give you a cleaner code which might help you minimize the functions' arguments lists.</p>

<p>In simple words an object can be anything you decide. Say a person. This is an object which I'll decide to define as a class if I'll write a program that needs to keep information regarding people.<br>
There are much better explanations than this, just google/wikipedia it.</p>

<p>Here's a blog post I wrote awhile back: <a href="http://www.truewill.net/myblog/index.php/2007/12/30/web_scraping_in_net" rel="nofollow">Web scraping in .NET</a>.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm trying to build an array in javascript that contains a list of ids.  Here is a simplified version of the function that I have...</p>

<pre><code>function updateCost(id) {
    var inputArray = [];
    inputArray.push(id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the html code...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="file" name="field1" id="field1" onchange="updateCost('1');" /&gt;
&lt;input type="file" name="field2" id="field2" onchange="updateCost('2');" /&gt;
&lt;input type="file" name="field3" id="field3" onchange="updateCost('3');" /&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to happen, is each time I select a file from my computer using one of the file input fields that I have, I would like the id of that input field to be stored in the inputArray array.  However, every time I select a file, it adds that id to the array, but it doesn't append it to the array, so everything else in the array is deleted, leaving only one entry in the array.</p>

<p>Is there any way to make the array data persistent so it will grow each time I use one of the of the file input fields?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>using enum.zip and block:</p>

<pre><code>class Array
  def to_hash(&amp;b)
    Hash[*self.zip([b.call]*self.size).flatten]
  end
end
#[1,2,3].to_hash{'n'} &gt;&gt; {1=&gt;'n',2=&gt;'n',3=&gt;'n'}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to be a quite typical use case for classes: Just add the "memory structure" as protected member of the class and initiliaze it in the constructor.</p>

<p>The member functions (aka "method") than can work on the data.</p>

<p>If you have different, but similiar use cases, you may also make use of subclassing, so you create a base class with default implementation and create some derived class that overwrites some of the methods with an own implementation.</p>

<p>But note, that you could also use other members varibales to set the behaviour at runtime (e.g. a bool that is used to toggle on or off a specific behaviour).</p>

<p>Your question is too abstract to see what is the best solution for your case. Remember, often there are a lot of solutions - and so there is more than one good solution.</p>

<p><strike>I wonder if <code>[actionSheet showInView: self.view];</code> is enough to have the actionSheet have itself retained by self.view.</strike> (<strong>edit</strong>: retain count jumps from 1 to 4 so not a problem here)</p>

<p>Have you checked the dimensions of your view? The sheet is positioned within the view, but if self.view would refer to a big scrollview, you might just have a sheet below the surface. In short, are you sure that self.view.frame and self.view.bounds have the same values in the two situations you are referring to? Is it the same view (when just <code>NSLog(@"%x",self.view)</code>-ing it's address)?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> to clarify: do</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@"%d %d %d %d",
        self.view.frame.origin.x,self.view.frame.origin.y,
        self.view.frame.size.width,self.view.frame.size.height);
</code></pre>

<p>and please tell what you see on the console. I get your "screen just gets darker" if I set either a 0,0,0,0 frame or a 0,0,320,800 frame, so this might be it...</p>

<p>In your app/config/routes.php file you could add:</p>

<p><code>Router::connect('/users/*', array('controller' =&gt; 'users', 'action' =&gt; 'index'));</code></p>

<p>This would route all requests to /users/ to the index action of the users controller.  If you want to use a different action, just replace 'index' with the action you prefer to use.</p>

<p>More info is here:</p>

<p><a href="http://book.cakephp.org/view/46/Routes-Configuration" rel="nofollow">http://book.cakephp.org/view/46/Routes-Configuration</a></p>

<p>I'm looking at this on an iPhone, so I can't see all of your code but you should probably be using ".html" instead of ".replaceWith". The former replaces the content <em>inside</em> the specifies tag, the latter wipes out the tags, too.</p>

<p>You can insert the city records, use mysql_insert_id() after the insert to get the cityid for the inserted record, and then redirect to a details posting page with e.g. a URL parameter for the cityid.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>unfortunately, I didn't find a nice way to do this with just a single macro.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMO, the easiest solution is to put default methods into macro. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;

#define DEFAULT_CLASS_METHODS(C) public: \
        virtual ~C(){}; \
    protected: \
        C(){}; \
    private: \
        inline C(const C&amp; rhs){}; \
        inline void operator=(const C&amp; other){}; 

class Output{
    DEFAULT_CLASS_METHODS(Output)
public:
    virtual void write(const std::vector&lt;char&gt; &amp;data) = 0;
};
</code></pre>

<p>This way you'll need only one macro per class definition in *.h file. You will need additional macro to actually declare copy constructor and assignment operator in some *.cpp file or you could make default copy constructor and assignment operators inline, which will wrap everything into single macro. </p>

<p>The only problem is that you'll need to type class name twice. </p>

<p>There is a less elegant way to do that without typing class name twice:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;vector&gt;

#define BEGIN_INTERFACE(C) class C{ \
    public: \
        virtual ~C(){}; \
    protected: \
        C(){}; \
    private: \
        inline C(const C&amp; rhs){}; \
        inline void operator=(const C&amp; other){}; 

BEGIN_INTERFACE(Output)
public:
    virtual void write(const std::vector&lt;char&gt; &amp;data) = 0;
};
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, in this case macro eats opening <code>{</code> bracket, which will be very misleading.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by <em>"selected by user text"</em>, but if you mean that you want the user to be able to click on the text to remove its color, you could do it this way with jQuery:</p>

<p><strong>Try it out:</strong> <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/</a></p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('div &gt; span').click(function() {
        $(this).removeAttr('style');
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this will affect all <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements that are a child of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, so better would be to place an ID attribute on the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to make sure you have the right one.</p>

<p><strong>Try it out:</strong> <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/1/</a></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="myID"&gt;&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:white;"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>then</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('#myID &gt; span').click(function() {
        $(this).removeAttr('style');
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that this will remove <em>all</em> inline styles. If you only want to remove the color, then do this:</p>

<p><strong>Try it out:</strong> <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/2/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/v24fZ/2/</a></p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('#myID &gt; span').click(function() {
        $(this).css('color', '');
    });
});

<p>Basically, I want to get an update of the standard command-line subversion client for Windows. I used to be able to get downloads of this quite easily, but it seems like registration is required these days.</p>

<p>I object to registration, but equally, I prefer not to use workarounds that e.g. involve registering with details that won't stay valid.</p>

<p>I already have TortoiseSVN - this isn't about clients in general, but specifically about the standard command-line client. I also don't need the server stuff - just the client.</p>

<p>It looks like I <em>can</em> download the source, but building from that probably involves the usual dependency-finding issues and so on. As this is likely to be a recurring issue, I'd prefer to avoid it if possible.</p>

<p>I'll be more than happy with a torrent link. Googling for that specifically, though, just leads to a lot of what look like pirate versions of commercial clients.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Or is there some good reason for collecting these registration details that might override my objections?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Applogies to everyone I "sigh"ed at or whatever over SlikSVN suggestions. Clearly, I need to do better at avoiding making bad assumptions.</p>

<pre><code>(function() {


   var inputArray = [];
   function updateCost(id) {
    inputArray.push(id);
   }


})();
</code></pre>

<p>Define it outside the scope of the function. You don't really need the enclosing anon function around, that's just my personal style.</p>

<p>Hi I'm trying to do the same way,  but I'm getting retCode= 11.  </p>

<p>any suggestion?</p>

<p>Use a <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html" rel="nofollow"><code>TreeSet</code></a> instead. It has a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/TreeSet.html#TreeSet%28java.util.Comparator%29" rel="nofollow">constructor taking a <code>Comparator</code></a>. It will automatically sort the <code>Set</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to convert a <code>HashSet</code> to a <code>TreeSet</code>, then do so:</p>

<pre><code>Set&lt;YourObject&gt; hashSet = getItSomehow();
Set&lt;YourObject&gt; treeSet = new TreeSet&lt;YourObject&gt;(new YourComparator());
treeSet.addAll(hashSet);
// Now it's sorted based on the logic as implemented in YourComparator.
</code></pre>

<p>If the items you have itself already implements <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Comparable</code></a> and its default ordering order is already what you want, then you basically don't need to supply a <code>Comparator</code>. You could then construct the <code>TreeSet</code> directly based on the <code>HashSet</code>. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; hashSet = getItSomehow();
Set&lt;String&gt; treeSet = new TreeSet&lt;String&gt;(hashSet);
// Now it's sorted based on the logic as implemented in String#compareTo().
</code></pre>

<p>As you said, you can certainly download and build the <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/source-code.html#source-release" rel="nofollow">source code</a>; it's free software under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" rel="nofollow">Apache License 2.0</a>.  But if you want to download an executable without Collab's registration, try <a href="http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download" rel="nofollow">SlikSvn</a>.</p>

<p>Which site are you downloading from?  Just taking a look at the download links from the SVN project home (http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html), I see four options for Windows, several of which do not have registration, at least.  The SlikSVN link is free and has command line utilities.</p>

<p>You could also install Cygwin, which is definitely free and comes with other useful utilities.</p>

<p>I'm new to hibernate. I have a transaction that fails with a HibernateException, yet the table is altered after the commit. Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>public StoreResult store(Entry entry)
{
    Session session = HibernateUtility.getSessionFactory().openSession();
    Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction();

    try
    {           
        String id;

        if (entry.getStatus() == Entry.Status.PUBLISHED)
        {
            id = TitleToURLConverter.convert(entry.getTitle());
        }
        else
        {
            id = "temp_";
        }

        if (entry.getId() == null)
        {
            entry.setId(id);
            session.save(entry);
        }
        else
        {
            session.update(entry);

            session.createQuery("update Entry set id = :newId where id = :oldId")
            .setString("newId", id)
            .setString("oldId", entry.getId())
            .executeUpdate();

            session.refresh(entry);
        }

        transaction.commit();

        return StoreResult.SUCCESS;
    }
    catch (RuntimeException e) 
    {
        transaction.rollback();
        if (e instanceof ConstraintViolationException) return StoreResult.DUPLICATE_ID;

        throw e;
    }
    finally
    {
        session.close();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Apparently InnoDB does not rollback the transaction on a duplicate key error but only the statement. I would like the transaction to be always rolled back on ANY error.</p>

<p>EDIT2: Disregard this. I was using MyIsam.</p>

<p>does anyone know how Eclipse determines which projects are in a particular workspace?  Is there a config file somewhere with this info?  I have struggled (in vain) for several hours trying to figure this out.</p>

<p>Binary distributions of the subversion client are available from the official subversion site.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Remove style from selected by user text"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you mean selecting by using a click event, it should be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var oldState = "";  //Code is untested, but I've written something similar recently
var $prevDiv;
$('#parentContainer span').click(function() {
    if(!$(this).hasClass('selected')) //tracking what is currently selected.
    { 
        if($prevDiv != null)
        {
            $prevDiv.removeClass('selected');  
            $prevDiv.attr('style', oldState);
        }
        $prevDiv = $(this);
        $(this).addClass('selected');
        oldState = $(this).attr('style');
        $(this).attr('style', '');

    }
    else 
    {
        //do nothing unless you need some reselected logic
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think @patrick dw covered the actual api for changing the attribute quite nicely, so I won't repeat it.</p>

<p>I'm getting used to Haskell's higher-order functions. Usually I can replace explicit patterns of recursion with functions like map, fold, and scan. However, I often run into the following recursion pattern which I don't understand how to express using higher-order functions:</p>

<pre><code>   f (x:[]) = k x
   f (x:xs) = g x (f xs)
</code></pre>

<p>For instance, suppose I am representing analytic tableaux. Then I create a data type such as:</p>

<pre><code>   data Tableau = N Expr | S Expr (Tableau) | B Expr (Tableau) (Tableau)
</code></pre>

<p>If I want to convert a list of <code>Expr</code>s into a tableau structure, I want a function part of which might resemble:</p>

<pre><code>   f (x:[]) = N x
   f (x:xs) = S x (f xs)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I see three options: (1) create a function which decides, given a tableau and a list, whether the next branch in the tableau should be an <code>S</code> or <code>N</code> (or <code>B</code>, but we'll ignore that case); (2) use a higher-order function to encapsulate the recursion pattern of <code>f</code>; (3) use a function like <code>f</code>. </p>

<p>What would the best option be?</p>

<p>WSGI itself offers no way of knowing what layers are already wrapping a certain application, nor does Apache know about that.  I would recommend having the <code>wsgiHandler</code> record its presence, so that you can avoid using it multiple times.  If you can't alter the existing code, you can do it with your own wrappers for that code's layer (and use the environment, directly or indirectly, to do the recording of what's already active).</p>

<p>I am currently working on my own version of membership using Entity Framework 4.0 and POCO.</p>

<p>After readying Scotts Gu blog post I decided to use conventions as much as possible.</p>

<p>So far I have a class called User:</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Key]
    public int UserId { get; set; }

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.StringLength(60)] 
    public string UserName { get; set; }

    public string Password { get; set; }

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.ConcurrencyCheck]
    public string Email { get; set; }

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Timestamp]
    public byte[] Timestamp { get; set; }

    public ICollection&lt;Role&gt; Roles { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and a class called Role</p>

<pre><code>public class Role
{
    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Key]
    public int RoleId { get; set; }

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.StringLength(50)]
    public string RoleName { get; set; }

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.StringLength(300)]
    public string RoleDescription { get; set; }

    public ICollection&lt;User&gt; Users { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also implement DbContext like this :</p>

<pre><code>public class BackboneDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet&lt;User&gt; Users { get; set; }
    public DbSet&lt;Role&gt; Roles { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then based on what Scott suggested I created a Initializer class inheriting from RecreateDatabaseIfModelChanges.</p>

<p>Then in that class I add some dummy items like this:</p>

<pre><code>    protected override void Seed(BackboneDbContext context)
    {
        var roles = new List&lt;Role&gt;
        {
            new Role
                {
                    RoleId = 0,
                    RoleName = "User",
                    RoleDescription = "This role belong to normal users.",
                }

        };

        roles.ForEach(r =&gt; context.Roles.Add(r));

        var users = new List&lt;User&gt;
        {
            new User  {UserId = 1, 
                       UserName = "Elham", 
                       Email = "abc@yahoo.com", 
                       Password = "xyz",
                       Roles = new List&lt;Role&gt;
                                   {
                                      roles[0]
                                   }

                       }

        };

        users.ForEach(u =&gt; context.Users.Add(u));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I hope it make sense up to here. If not, basically the above code populate the tables with dummy data if database schema changes.</p>

<p>so far everything is absolutely great. I get the following tables:</p>

<p>Roles, Roles_Users and Users</p>

<p>they all have the info I need, but the problem is when I use the following LINQ query in my Repository class to get all the USers:</p>

<pre><code>    public IQueryable&lt;User&gt; GetAllUsers()
    {
        IQueryable&lt;User&gt; allUsers = from u in _backboneDbContext.Users select u;

        return allUsers;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>now if I check allUsers before passing it to View, I get my users but the Role is set to 'Null'</p>

<p>I don't know why... Any Ideas ? Thank you.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to do this?</p>

<p>Is anyone able to provide an example? I believe this is out of NDA now as was available in version 4.0 ?</p>

<p>Learn about how to create a custom membership provider, then see why Microsoft guys make it that way. </p>

<p>Actually the provider is a bridge between a User object, and its data stored in the database or another place. So a custom membership provider offers you enough flexibility.</p>

<p>The general technique of allowing a window instance to be represented by as class instance is to make use of the SetWindowLongPtr and GetWindowLongPtr to associate your class instance pointer with the window handle.  Below is some sample code to get you started.  It may not compile without a few tweaks.  It's only meant to be a reference.</p>

<p>Personally, I've stopped rolling my own window classes back a few years ago when I discovered ATL's CWindow and CWindowImpl template class.  They take care of doing all this mundane coding for you so can focus on just writing methods that handle window messages.  See the example code I wrote up <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3122695/what-is-an-efficient-way-to-wrap-hwnds-in-objects-in-c/3122743#3122743">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>Using SQLite and Python 3.1, I want to display currency data in a HTML table via. a template which accepts a cursor as a parameter.  Hence all currency values must have 2 decimal places, but SQLite stores them as float type (even though the structure states decimal :-( ) so some must be converted before display (eg. I want 12.1 displayed as 12.10).</p>

<p>The code goes something like this (simplified for illustration)...</p>

<pre><code>import sqlite3
con = sqlite3.connect("mydb")
con.row_factory = sqlite3.Row

cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute("select order_no, amount from orders where cust_id=123")

for row in cur:
   row['amount'] = format(row['amount'],'%.2f')
</code></pre>

<p>The last command throws the error "# builtins.TypeError: 'sqlite3.Row' object does not support item assignment"</p>

<p>How can I solve the problem whereby the row object values cannot be changed?  Could I convert the cursor to a list of dictionaries (one for each row, eg. [{'order_no':1, 'amount':12.1}, {'order_no':2, 'amount':6.32}, ...]), then format the 'amount' value for each item?  If so, how can I do this?</p>

<p>Are there any better solutions for achieving my goal?  Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>TIA,
Alan</p>

<p>A variable is <em>defined</em> as a storage location. So the question is: does a storage location <em>consume memory</em>? </p>

<p>When you say it that way it sounds obvious that the answer is yes. What else would a storage location do other than consume memory?</p>

<p>It's not as simple as that. A local variable can consume no memory at all; a local variable <em>might be enregistered by the jitter</em>. In that case it would consume neither stack nor heap memory.</p>

<p>Why do you care? The way that the CLR manages memory to make storage locations for variables is an implementation detail. Unless you're writing unsafe code, you don't have to worry about it.</p>

<p>You can do it all through the control panel.   Each theme has a <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Appearance_Themes_SubPanel" rel="nofollow">Delete link</a> that you can use to wipe it from the server's file system.   Once it's gone, you can re-intall your updated version.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm writing a web page. How do I know what doc type to use?:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I believe the rationale behind using Transitional is that if your page uses deprecated html elements, the browsers will try to support them? </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>It is quite likely that your problem arises due to the presence of a default (xhtml) namespace in the source XHTML file (which you have not shown to us, so this is a guess at best).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can someone explain the correct way to
  remove  and all its
  children from the identity transform?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Here is how to do this in case a default namespace is present</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
 xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
 xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
 &lt;xsl:output omit-xml-declaration="yes" indent="yes"/&gt;
 &lt;xsl:strip-space elements="*"/&gt;

 &lt;xsl:template match="node()|@*"&gt;
     &lt;xsl:copy&gt;
       &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="node()|@*"/&gt;
     &lt;/xsl:copy&gt;
 &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

 &lt;xsl:template match="xhtml:div[@class='foo']"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>When this transformation is applied on the following XHTML document</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
    &lt;div class="class1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Text1&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="foo"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Text foo&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="class2"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Text2&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>the wanted, correct result is produced</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;
   &lt;div class="class1"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Text1&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div class="class2"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Text2&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Using a namespace prefix in the match expression of the template is necessary</strong>, because XPath considers any unprefixed name in "no namespace" and a match expression with non-prefixed names does not match any nodes, because it specifies nodes in "no namspace", but all the nodes of the source document are in the XHTML namespace.</p>

<p><strong>In case there is no default namespace in the source document, the transformation can be simplified</strong>:</p>

<p>
 
 </p>

<p>You can always check Request.ServerVariables["REMOTE_HOST"] against your own white list within your app.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure you can't do it for a single page via IIS (seek Serverfault.com for more details if you want verification), but if you wanted to do it programmatically, you could hook Application_BeginRequest in your global.asax file. Check the request URL and the request IP address against your restrictions, and only allow the request to continue if they pass. </p>

<p>The following resource demonstrates how to detect the client IP in ASP.NET:</p>

<p><a href="http://bytes.com/topic/asp-classic/answers/439176-how-get-clients-ip-address-asp-net" rel="nofollow">http://bytes.com/topic/asp-classic/answers/439176-how-get-clients-ip-address-asp-net</a></p>

<p>Once you have the IP, load your whitelist from the storage mechanism of your choice, perhaps during an Init event (if in a page), and if the IP fails to match, respond like so (Use <code>HttpContext.Current.Response</code> if not in a page:</p>

<pre><code>if (!mySafeIpList.Contains(clientIP))
{
    Response.Clear()
    Response.StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized
    Response.End()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, just simply redirect to a valid page:</p>

<pre><code>Response.Redirect("~/Head-Fake.aspx")
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>hey all,</p>

<p>is it possible to have some sort of <strong>very</strong> simple reversible encryption in php that can be reversed using C# Winforms?</p>

<p>thank you</p>

<p>I would be happy to send anyone the code I have... It all works fine as a webpage but then in Facebook all of the page loads and no errors show but the twitter profile widget does not appear.
If you want to take a look at the FB page as is click the link. On the left side under twitter updates is where the code is pasted.
Thanks

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm using a table element in my page layout (because I can't get divs to work 100% the way I want).</p>

<p>I just read this article about using a table style for divs:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/everything_you_know_about_CSS_Is_wrong/" rel="nofollow">http://www.digital-web.com/articles/everything_you_know_about_CSS_Is_wrong/</a></p>

<p>is this widely supported right now, is anyone using this method? If I look at major sites like twitter etc, I see tables being used, so I'm wondering if it's not a good idea to switch over,</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi everyone.
I'm struggling with this simple idea.
Look at reddit, when you sign up for a new account.. you automatically subscribe to some default channels.</p>

<p>I want to do the same with my website.</p>

<p>I know I could do the simple and stupid <strong>user_chan</strong> with id, user_id, chan_id</p>

<p>if <strong>chan</strong> is like this :</p>

<pre><code>ID | NAME
1  | videos
2  | pictures
</code></pre>

<p><strong>user_chan</strong> would be like this (i'm user 1)</p>

<pre><code>ID | USER_ID | CHAN_ID
1  | 1       | 1
2  | 1       | 2
</code></pre>

<p>I'm trying to be very clear here :D</p>

<p>I guess that's how reddit works. But everytime a user signs up, they must have to insert a dozen of rows. And I guess they have tons of users !!</p>

<p>So is a solution inside <strong>user</strong> table like this more clever ?:</p>

<pre><code>ID | USER_NICKNAME | CHANS
1  | me            | 1,2
</code></pre>

<p>Yep...:</p>

<pre><code>dictrows = [dict(row) for rows in cur]
for r in dictrows:
  r['amount'] = format(r['amount'],'%.2f')
</code></pre>

<p>there are other ways, but this one seems the simplest and most direct one.</p>

<p>I was able to grab only individual <code>_enclosed_</code> words via:</p>

<pre><code>$input = 'test of _this_ vs stuff_like_this...and here is _anothermatch_ and_another_fake_string';
$pattern = '#(?&lt;=\s|^)(?&lt;!_)(_[^_]*_)(?!_)#is';
preg_match_all($pattern, $input, $matches);
print_r($matches);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure how exactly that would fit into the above code though. You would probably need to pair it with the other patterns below to account for the two and three match situations:</p>

<pre><code>$pattern = '#(?&lt;=\s|^)(?&lt;!_)(__[^_]*__)(?!_)#is';
$pattern = '#(?&lt;=\s|^)(?&lt;!_)(___[^_]*___)(?!_)#is';
</code></pre>

<p>Hello, </p>

<p>I am using <code>contentEditable</code> div tags on my website and I have noticed a weird issue when using Firefox.</p>

<p><strong>Here is example source code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div contentEditable="true" style="margin-left:auto; 
         margin-right:auto; height:200px; width:200px; border-style:solid; 
         border-color:black; border-width:1px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Here are the steps to reproduce.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><code>contentEditable</code> has focus and cursor
is blinking within the div, but
there is NO text in the div</li>
<li>user click on the <code>contentEditable</code>
div</li>
<li>the div still shows focus, but there
is now NO blinking cursor, and the
user cannot enter input into the div</li>
</ol>

<p>I have reproduced this error with Firefox 3.6.3 on Ubuntu, and Firefox 3.5 on Windows XP. It does not happen with Chrome.</p>

<p>Any ideas about why this is happening and what to do to fix it?</p>

<p><b> EDIT: </b> One possible work around might be to manually set where the cursor is. Does anyone know how to do this? I've been searching online, but it doesn't look like there is anything W3 supported.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I use RegexBuddy too. :)</p>

<p>You may want to try the following code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

$line1 = "like_this_example";
$line2 = "I want only _example_ to become example";
$pattern = '/\b_(?P&lt;word&gt;.*?)_\b/si';

if (preg_match($pattern, $line1, $matches))
{
  $result = $matches['word'];
  var_dump($result);
}

if (preg_match($pattern, $line2, $matches))
{
  $result = $matches['word'];
  var_dump($result);
}

?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Do not use one column to store multiple values. This is a denormalization that will cause pain later. E.g., when you need to query which user has channel 3, you are going to have to use <code>LIKE</code>, which will perform badly. When you need to remove just one channel of the several the user has, it gets even harder.</p>

<p>With most databases, you can insert multiple rows with one <code>INSERT</code> statement. The exact syntax varies by platform; in SQL Server, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>insert into user_chan
(USER_ID, CHANID)
select 7634, 3
union all
select 7634, 27
union all
select 7634, 9
</code></pre>

<p>Seems to be supported in <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/display.html" rel="nofollow">all but Internet Explorer 5, 6 and 7.</a></p>

<p>Well, you could maybe use <code>Set</code> instead and use the <code>removeAll()</code> method.</p>

<p>Or you could use the following simple and slow algorithm for doing:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Animal&gt; differences = new ArrayList&lt;Animal&gt;();

    for (Animal a1 : animals) {
       boolean isInSecondArray = false;
       for (Animal a2 : animals2) {
           if (a1 == a2)  {
                isInSecondArray = true;
                break;
           }
       } 

       if (!isInSecondArray)
           differences.add(a1)
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then <code>differences</code> will have all the objects that are in <code>animals</code> array but not in <code>animals2</code> array. In a similar way you can do the opposite (get all the objects that are in <code>animals2</code> but not in <code>animals</code>).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"

<p>HTML 4 Strict DTD if you </p>

<p>a) Don't plan on using HTML 5 elements</p>

<p>b) Don't plan on really using xhtml with Content-Type of application/xhtml+xml</p>

<p>In this day and age you really shouldn't be "transitioning" or trying to using old, deprecated non-standard elements. Go standard all the way.</p>

<p>If you do plan on trying out HTML 5, by all means just use <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</code> which is the HTML 5 DTD.</p>

<p>By executing <code>delete</code> twice (or even <code>free</code>), the memory may already be reallocated and by executing <code>delete</code> again may cause memory corruption. The size of the block of memory allocated is often held just before the memory block itself. </p>

<p>If you have a derived class, do not call delete on the derived class (child). If it is not declared virtual then only the <code>~BaseClass()</code> destructor is called leaving any allocated memory from the <code>DerivedClass</code> to persist and leak. This assumes that the <code>DerivedClass</code> has extra memory allocated above and beyond that of the <code>BaseClass</code> which must be freed. </p>

<p>i.e.</p>

<pre><code>BaseClass* obj_ptr = new DerivedClass;  // Allowed due to polymorphism.
...
delete obj_ptr;  // this will call the destructor ~Parent() and NOT ~Child()

<p><a href="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/" rel="nofollow">This site</a> contains excellent background information and a <a href="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/#handling" rel="nofollow">compatibilty table</a>. Here's an extract of relevance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Standards mode, more stable validation target</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>This doctype also triggers the standards mode, and the decade-old HTML 4.01 validity definition is stable. Please be sure to test your image alignment in Firefox, Safari, Chrome or Opera 9 or 10. Testing image alignment with Internet Explorer is inadequate however be sure to test in IE8, too.</p>
  
  <h3>You’d like to use the Standards mode, but you still want to validate deprecated markup or you use sliced images in table layouts and don’t want to fix them</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>This gives you the Almost Standards mode (and the full Standards mode in really old Mozilla releases). Please note that your layouts based on sliced images in tables are <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/faq.html#gaps" rel="nofollow">likely to break</a> if you later move to HTML5 (and, hence, the full Standards mode).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'd say, go for HTML5 doctype <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, unless you want a more stable validation target.</p>

<p>I'd use <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/2005/07/html5-doctype" rel="nofollow"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></a>, it's by far the easiest alternative, and it triggers standards mode in all modern browsers as <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/2005/07/html5-doctype" rel="nofollow">Anne van Kesteren noted several years ago</a>.</p>

<p>When I install pyAA and run depends on _pyAAc.pyd, it tells me I'm missing IESHIMS.DLL, though that might be because I'm on Windows 7.</p>

<p>The key difference between T-SQL and Win32 Filestream access is the way data is transferred to the client - using T-SQL to retrieve Filestream data means the storage engine must open the file on NTFS, stream data back through the SQL engine and through TDS (the standard way SQL data is transferred) back to the client. If using Win32 the storage engine is still in the path during the open file operation however once this is complete the data can be transferred directly from the file to the client through Win32 streaming, completely bypassing the SQL engine.</p>

<p>As the blob size increases the overhead of opening the file and transferring through the engine becomes a smaller percentage of the total time required to complete the data transfer. Recent benchmarks for a very specific case study put the thresholds at 60KB for inline (varbinary max storage), 60KB-1.2MB for T-SQL transfer and >1.2MB for Win32 transfer. As I mentioned this was for a very specific case so YMMV.</p>

<p>As far as security goes I can see a number of issues with using SQL security in this way, but it's hard to offer suggestions without a little more context. You're really restricted from benefiting from Filestream by accessing it solely through T-SQL.</p>

<p>I put together a simple system so that my dad can manage a website for his club volleyball team.  He's not very familiar with html markups so I'm trying to keep this as simple as possible for him.  Here is what I have him right now:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="text_block"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;section heading&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;image src="" /&gt;  &lt;- optional image
    &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with the following css rules:</p>

<pre><code>.text_block {
padding : 1em 0;
min-height : 300px;
}
.text_block img {
float : left;
padding : 0 25px 15px 0;
}
.text_block p {
text-align : justify;
padding : 0 1.5em;
}
</code></pre>

<p>without the min-height declaration on the wrapper div I get messes like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100801-dcb4x7uw41gkn48x1fdahys994.jpg" alt="Messy paragraphs">.</p>

<p>since some of the images don't have much text in their div wrap.</p>

<p>When I DO include the min-height element we get big gaps where there are small paragraphs and no images.  Worst case scenario I could have him tag the "text_block" divs as "text_block has_image" for those with images, but I would like to keep this as simple as possible.</p>

<p>Can anyone help me out with this?  It would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>For some reason, one of my models in rails is returning nil when I call .new. This is only a problem in the controller. When I try on the console, it returns an object with nil attributes as I would expect. I suspect the problem is in my controller, but I have no idea. </p>

<p>This also happens when I call .all. Again, I can execute these commands manually from the command line without issue.</p>

<p>Here's the controller code:</p>

<p><a href="http://gist.github.com/502816" rel="nofollow">http://gist.github.com/502816</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Looks like a few of my other models are acting the same way. This problem is clearly deeper than this controller/model. I'm still very new to rails, so I'm not sure where to look to debug this.</p>

<p>EDIT2: A wise friend of mine helped me figure out that the controller action isn't even being called. My before filter, however, is, but it is not redirecting. So somehow, the right controller is found, but the appropriate action isn't called.</p>

<p>My server log <em>SAYS</em> the right action is being processed, but the actual function body doesn't seem to execute.</p>

<p>Yes.  Algorithms are not language specific.</p>

<p>I want to inspect the request that will change <code>window.location</code> or whatever it may be using to change the url.  I don't know where in the code it is changing the url so I can't put a breakpoint in there.</p>

<p>How can I use Firebug to allow Ajax requests but prevent the url from changing?  Or how can I otherwise inspect the request that will change the url?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You're sleeping on the main UI thread, which stops the operating system from handling your application's events. This will stop your app from redrawing and as you discovered, can prevent new windows from actually appearing.</p>

<p>Instead of sleeping, try this:</p>

<pre><code>final ProgressDialog dialog = ProgressDialog.show(
    SettingsActivity.this, "", "Doing stuff...", true);
new Handler().postDelayed(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
      dialog.hide();
    }
  }, 2000);
</code></pre>

<p>I suggest that you put your objects in sets and then use an intersection of the sets:</p>

<pre><code>// Considering you put your objects in setA and setB

Set&lt;Object&gt; intersection = new HashSet&lt;Object&gt;(setA);
intersection.retainAll(setB);
</code></pre>

<p>After that you can use removeAll to get a difference to any of the two sets:</p>

<pre><code>setA.removeAll(intersection);
setB.removeAll(intersection);
</code></pre>

<p>Hi to all,</p>

<p>I've created a web application, and now i want to build some REST APIs to make it programmable by third party developers. Then, i want to build some client libraries in some popular languages (JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, etc) to make devs confortable using my service by avoiding them to parse by hand the JSON response of each request.</p>

<p>I've never built an API infrastructure before, so i have the following question.
I'd like to track the usage of the APIs methods called by third party developers. Each developer, before consuming the APIs, must be registered and so i want to associate each request to the registered developer (and so, set some specific usage limits, etc).</p>

<p>I thought to create an unique api key for each developer that he could use into all his apps, to authenticate the requests. But then i realized that if he decides to use my javascript wrapper, then malicious users could view the source code of the client app page and grab his api key.
So, i decided that it would be better to create a unique api key for every application, associated to the domain where the client app would be hosted. So that even if a user grabs someone else key, then it would be useless outside the domain where it was originally registered.
But then i thought: what about mobile apps? What happens if the call is made not from a website? How can i authenticate the key through its domain if there's no domain or the IP address is not static?</p>

<p>Any tips?<br /></p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Sadly no pure HTML/CSS way to do it as neither is geared to perform calculations like that.  However, it's pretty simple with a snippet of jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>$('img.toResizeClass').each(function(){
    var imgWidth = $(this).width();
    var imgHeight = $(this).height();

    if(imgWidth &gt; imgHeight){
        $(this).width(imgWidth * 0.3);
    } else {
        $(this).height(imgHeight * 0.3);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to look at this article for more information:</p>

<p><a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/set.html" rel="nofollow">http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/set.html</a></p>

<p>As was mentioned, <code>removeAll()</code> is made for this, but you will want to do it twice, so that you can create a list of all that are missing in both, and then you could combine these two results to have a list of all the differences.</p>

<p>But, this is a destructive operation, so if you don't want to lose the information, copy the <code>Set</code> and operate on that one.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>It appears that my assumption of what is in the array is wrong, so <code>removeAll()</code> won't work, but with a 5ms requirement, depeending on the number of items to search it could be a problem.</p>

<p>So, it would appear a <code>HashMap&lt;String, Animal&gt;</code> would be the best option, as it is fast in searching.</p>

<p>Animal is an interface with at least one property, <code>String name</code>. For each class that implements <code>Animal</code> write code for <code>Equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code>. You can find some discussion here: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp05273.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-jtp05273.html</a>.  This way, if you want the hash value to be a combination of the type of animal and the name then that will be fine.</p>

<p>So, the basic algorithm is to keep everything in the hashmaps, and then to search for differences, just get an array of keys, and search through to see if that key is contained in the other list, and if it isn't put it into a <code>List&lt;Object&gt;</code>, storing the value there.
You will want to do this twice, so, if you have at least a dual-core processor, you may get some benefit out of having both searches being done in separate threads, but then you will want to use one of the concurrent datatypes added in JDK5 so that you don't have to worry about synchronizations in the combined list of differences.</p>

<p>So, I would write it first as a single-thread and test, to get some ideas as to how much faster it is, also comparing it to the original implmemntation.
Then, if you need it faster, try using threads, again, compare to see if there is a speed increase.</p>

<p>Before making any optimization ensure you have some metrics on what you already have, so that you can compare and see if the one change will lead to an increase in speed. </p>

<p>If you make too many changes at a time, one may have a large improvement on speed, but others may lead to a performance decrease, and it wouldn't be seen, which is why each change should be one at a time.</p>

<p>Don't lose the other implementations though, by using unit tests and testing perhaps 100 times each, you can get an idea as to what improvement each change gives you.</p>

<p>Your <code>.text_block</code> isn't <a href="http://work.arounds.org/clearing-floats/" rel="nofollow">clearing the floats</a>, set <code>overflow:hidden; zoom:1;</code> and remove the min height. That should set you straight. </p>

<p>You can alternatively set <code>clear:both;</code> so it clears the floats above. The reason why I'd go with the former is because when you inspect the element, since it's clearing itself the dimensions/bordering by the inspecting tool ( Firebug and such ) will look "right." Of course visually it doesn't really matter but I like it that way.</p>

<p>Use the clear property on the text_block class:</p>

<pre><code>.text_block { clear: both; }
</code></pre>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm a pretty seasoned PHP developer, and have integrated APIs before with platforms like PayPal and Authorize.Net after finding classes to work with... It's just that now I have to implement with limelight network's API and I have to start from scratch... Here's what I want to do after receiving a callback, posted to a PHP page I make:</p>

<p>Grab the XML in its raw form and send it to myself in an email so I can analyze what I'm working with.</p>

<p>No code yet, just an email function... the question is: how can I extract the XML from the post?  I'm sure I would need to make a handler, but I'm not certain where to start. Please advise.  Thanks!</p>

<p>You can wrap the ajax request in a function and return false. Then you can click it and it wont take you away. For example, I have a function that looks like this</p>

<pre><code>$('.flag-commentflag a').click(function() {
    var url = $(this).attr('href');
    $.get (url, function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    });
 return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>Where .flag-commentflag is the class of the div surrounding the link.</p>

<p>If I've understood the question properly, then here's my evaluation of your options:</p>

<p>1) It's probably a bit nasty to have to match the (presumably arbitrarily complex?) tableau out from underneath the constructor in order to write that function.  This approach seems somewhat brittle, although it would probably work just fine.</p>

<p>2) I don't see the need to generalise the pattern out, given that it's a recursive function operating on a recursive structure.  Introducing a higher-order pattern would (I think) obfuscate the actual logic behind performing a recursive traversal of this data structure.</p>

<p>3) I think this makes a good deal of sense.  As you've observed, it's a reasonably recognised "pattern", but I think it matches the description of the algorithm well to write it down in exactly this way.  It may not be as generalisable or reusable, but given that it's essentially the crux of the algorithmic approach, I think it makes sense to write the cases directly as you have done in a function like f.  This would be my favoured approach.</p>

<p>Sorry to not provide a particularly concrete answer, but it is a reasonably subjective answer, so given the three options above, I would pick option 3 for reasons of clarity and readability.</p>

<p>I have a serialized object which needs to be sent as an encrypted XML string. I am able to save the serialized object to a well-formed XML file, but this is not what I want. I have already got Rijndael encrypt/decrypt working for a sample string.</p>

<pre><code>Person person = new Person("Irish", "Chieftain");
XmlSerializer xmlSerializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Person));

// Write serialized XML to file
System.Guid guid = System.Guid.NewGuid();
StreamWriter streamWriter 
    = new StreamWriter(@"C:\application" + "_" + guid.ToString() + ".xml")
xmlSerializer.Serialize(streamWriter.BaseStream, person);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>I want to be able to display the XML string in the browser</strong>, before encryption, to test that the correct encrypted string is being sent to the decrypt method on the other machine.</p>

<p>I have been beating on this for a week and have looked to other answers on SO, such as:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/543319/how-to-return-xml-in-asp-net">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/543319/how-to-return-xml-in-asp-net</a></p>

<p>Can anyone show me the correct syntax to display the generated XML as a string in the browser?</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong>
Here is what I'm trying to render the XML:</p>

<pre><code>MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
XmlTextWriter xmlWriter2 = new XmlTextWriter(memoryStream, Encoding.UTF8); 
xmlWriter2.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;
xmlSerializer.Serialize(xmlWriter2, person);
memoryStream = (MemoryStream) xmlWriter2.BaseStream;
UTF8Encoding encoding2 = new UTF8Encoding();
stringData = encoding2.GetString(memoryStream.ToArray());
Response.ContentType = "text/xml";
Response.Write(stringData);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 2]</strong></p>

<p>If I remove the "text/xml" content type, I get the following when I view source (is this correct?):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;Person xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"&gt;
  &lt;FirstName&gt;Irish&lt;/FirstName&gt;
  &lt;SecondName&gt;Chieftain&lt;/SecondName&gt;
&lt;/Person&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>[Update 3]</strong></p>

<p>Working version:</p>

<pre><code>            #region Display original string
            // Write serialized XML to a string - Display purposes.
            MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
            XmlTextWriter xmlWriter2 
                = new XmlTextWriter(memoryStream, Encoding.UTF8);
            xmlWriter2.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;
            xmlSerializer.Serialize(xmlWriter2, person);
            memoryStream = (MemoryStream) xmlWriter2.BaseStream;
            UTF8Encoding encoding2 = new UTF8Encoding();
            stringData = encoding2.GetString(memoryStream.ToArray());

            Response.Clear();
            Response.ContentType = "text/xml";
            Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);
            Response.Cache.SetAllowResponseInBrowserHistory(true);
            Response.Write(stringData);
            Response.End();
            #endregion

<p>I use <code>MPMoviePlayerViewController</code> to make a moviePlayer.  But, when I click the "done" button, or cancel the player, the memory used always increases.  Why??</p>

<p>I'm trying to split an HTML string by a token in order to create a blog preview without displaying the full post. It's a little <em>harder</em> than I first thought. Here are the problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>A user will be creating the HTML
through a WYSIWYG editor (CKEditor).
The markup isn't guaranteed to be
pretty or consistent.</li>
<li>The token, <code>read_more()</code>, can
be placed anywhere in the string,
including being nested within a
paragraph tag.</li>
<li>The resulting first split string
needs to be valid HTML for all
reasonable uses of the token.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of possible uses:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Some text here. read_more()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some text read more() here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;read_more()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  read_more()&lt;/p&gt;

read_more()
</code></pre>

<p>So far, I've tried just splitting the string on the token, but it leaves invalid HTML. Regex is perhaps another option. What strategy would you use to solve this and make it as bulletproof as possible? Any code snippets or hints would also be appreciated (I'm using PHP).</p>

<p>Sure. In the PHP part you can use the bitwise operator <code>^</code>, but you'll first have to convert the string into an array of integers (e.g. <code>array_map('ord', str_split($str))</code>) and then do an inner product with the one-time pad, xor taking the role of multiplication and concatenation taking the role of addition.</p>

<p>Remember that if you re-use the pad, the security of the encryption falls apart.</p>

<p>If the only user affected by the CSS is the user that provided the CSS, then there's not much of a risk. Any XSS vulnerability could only affect the user.</p>

<p>Some browsers allow users to use custom CSS anyway, or ignore it altogether, so I wouldn't consider it a problem.</p>

<p>The problem is that since your container div is not floated, it is being pushed over by the image when the p tags don't take up enough space.</p>

<p>You could float the container divs as well to make everything stay inside (though this might give you some issues with whatever contains your container divs)</p>

<p>The other option would be to add some kind of clearing div at the end of each container</p>

<pre><code>div.clear {
  float:none;
  clear:both;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>suppose <code>$my_ref = \$hash{'mary'};</code> <code>#my_ref</code> is a reference point to a hash element.<br>
....<br>
later on, how can I use <code>$my_ref</code> to retrieve the key of the hash element it point to? i.e how to get string 'mary' from <code>$my_ref</code>?</p>

<p>I ask this question because I have several groups of user name list, some user names appear in multiple groups which consumes memory. So I decide to create a common user name list, and let these groups only store the reference to the corresponding user name rather than user name.   </p>

<p>e.g. originally,  </p>

<pre><code>%group1 = {'mary'=&gt;1, 'luke'=1,'tom'=1,...}  
%group2 = {'mary'=&gt;1, 'sam'=1,'tom'=1,...}
</code></pre>

<p>Here you see 'mary' and 'tom' are shown in both <code>group1</code> and <code>group2</code> which consume memory. (note I do not care the value in this example, the value is here only because the data struct is a hash). So to reduce memory, I want to have a common list stores all user names:   </p>

<pre><code>%common_hash = {'mary'=&gt;1, 'luke'=1,'tom'=1,'sam'=1...};  
$ref1 = \$common_hash{'mary'};  
$ref2 = \$common_hash{'luke'};  
$ref3 = \$common_hash{'tom'};  
$ref4 = \$common_hash{'sam'};
</code></pre>

<p>groups only store the reference of the hash element:  </p>

<pre><code>%group1 = {$ref1=&gt;1, $ref2=1,$ref3=1,...};  
%group2 = {$ref1=&gt;1, $ref4=1,$ref3=1,...}; 
</code></pre>

<p>I think this approach can save much memory because:</p>

<ol>
<li>one user name is store in memory once not multiple times;</li>
<li>groups stores reference (an integer) rather than string (in my case, the length of each user name is 30 bytes in average, while each integer is only 4 bytes (32 bit sys.) or 8 bytes (64 bit sys.)) (BTW, correct me if an integer does not use 4 bytes or 8 bytes.)</li>
<li>using reference I can access user name immediately without looking for it.</li>
</ol>

<p>But how can I get the user name from a group?  </p>

<p>If I use <code>@my_ref = keys %group1</code>, I think I will get value of 'mary',but not 'mary'.      </p>

<pre><code>$result = $($my_ref[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>How can I change this code to add a UIImage and then move it using the accelerometer? Then how do you detect if it collides with another image?</p>

<p>Thanks! </p>

<p>It can be done from assembly, but it isn't easy.  You can't use int 21h, that's a DOS system call and it isn't available under Linux.</p>

<p>To get characters from the terminal under UNIX-like operating systems (such as Linux), you read from STDIN (file number 0).  Normally, the read system call will block until the user presses enter.  This is called canonical mode.  To read a single character without waiting for the user to press enter, you must first disable canonical mode.  Of course, you'll have to re-enable it if you want line input later on, and before your program exits.</p>

<p>To disable canonical mode on Linux, you send an IOCTL (IO ControL) to STDIN, using the ioctl syscall.  I assume you know how to make Linux system calls from assembler.</p>

<p>The ioctl syscall has three parameters.  The first is the file to send the command to (STDIN), the second is the IOCTL number, and the third is typically a pointer to a data structure.  ioctl returns 0 on success, or a negative error code on fail.</p>

<p>The first IOCTL you need is TCGETS (number 0x5401) which gets the current terminal parameters in a termios structure.  The third parameter is a pointer to a termios structure.  From the kernel source, the termios structure is defined as:</p>

<pre><code>struct termios {
    tcflag_t c_iflag;               /* input mode flags */
    tcflag_t c_oflag;               /* output mode flags */
    tcflag_t c_cflag;               /* control mode flags */
    tcflag_t c_lflag;               /* local mode flags */
    cc_t c_line;                    /* line discipline */
    cc_t c_cc[NCCS];                /* control characters */
};
</code></pre>

<p>where tcflag_t is 32 bits long, cc_t is one byte long, and NCCS is currently defined as 19.  See the NASM manual for how you can conveniently define and reserve space for structures like this.</p>

<p>So once you've got the current termios, you need to clear the canonical flag.  This flag is in the c_lflag field, with mask ICANON (0x00000002).  To clear it, compute c_lflag AND (NOT ICANON). and store the result back into the c_lflag field.</p>

<p>Now you need to notify the kernel of your changes to the termios structure.  Use the TCSETS (number 0x5402) ioctl, with the third parameter set the the address of your termios structure.</p>

<p>If all goes well, the terminal is now in non-canonical mode.  You can restore canonical mode by setting the canonical flag (by ORing c_lflag with ICANON) and calling the TCSETS ioctl again. <strong>always restore canonical mode before you exit</strong></p>

<p>As I said, it isn't easy.</p>

<p>Perhaps A.f(String) should be A.f(CharSequence) instead.  You can mock a CharSequence.</p>

<p>I'm following a tutorial from chapter 12 of the book "Beginning iPhone 3 Development." When I try to build the project I get an error. The book came with the project files, so I went through every file in my Classes directory and copied and pasted the code from the example project so that they are identical. This has solved my build errors in the past. I checked that the same frameworks were installed and the files in the Other Sources and Resources folder are identical. Still, when I try to build, I get the following build error:</p>

<p>From what I can see my project is identical to the one supplied with the book, which I can build and run successfully. What could possibly still be different that is causing this error?</p>

<p>Hello, </p>

<p>I am getting an infinite loop in the URL redirect after a user either logs in or is already logged in. The page redirects to the login page if the user is not logged in as expected , but goes in the loop as soon as he enters the credentials. </p>

<p>Following is the code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

include_once ('facebook.php');
  $api_key = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx';
  $secret  = 'xxxxxxxxxxxx';
  global $facebook;
  $facebook = new Facebook($api_key, $secret);
$facebook-&gt;require_frame();
$uid = $facebook-&gt;require_login($required_permissions = 'email,status_update,offline_access');
$facebook-&gt;api_client-&gt;users_hasAppPermission("offline_access",$uid);
#echo $uid;
 #   $facebook-&gt;api_client-&gt;users_setStatus("hello",$uid);
  #   echo "&lt;p&gt;Your status has been updated&lt;/p&gt;";
 ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly this code was working before, but suddenly started giving me an infinite loop problem. There have been couple of discussion on facebook forum about this but no indication that is a bug or what is the workaround . </p>

<p>Any help would be highly appreciateed. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'm creating a time-series object with new variables using the transform() function in R and cannot find the proper function to calculate the difference in variable C between today and yesterday.</p>

<p>This is what I've got so far:</p>

<pre><code>                 O       H       L       C  Typical Range 
2010-07-23 1092.17 1103.73 1087.88 1102.66 1098.090 15.85 
2010-07-26 1102.89 1115.01 1101.30 1115.01 1110.440 13.71  
2010-07-27 1117.36 1120.95 1109.78 1113.84 1114.857 11.17  
2010-07-28 1112.84 1114.66 1103.11 1106.13 1107.967 11.55  
2010-07-29 1108.07 1115.90 1092.82 1101.53 1103.417 23.08  
2010-07-30 1098.44 1106.44 1088.01 1101.60 1098.683 18.43
</code></pre>

<p>The next row will be added with the following function:</p>

<pre><code>SPX &lt;- transform(SPX, Return = (C - C(yesterday) ) / C(yesterday)))
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, C(yesterday) is incorrect. I've tried lag(), diff() and haven't found the correct combination. </p>

<p>Bonus question: How do you get the Typical variable to show only to the hundreth?</p>

<p>I have a method in a Utils class that does this conversion:</p>

<pre><code>public static int dip(Context context, int pixels) {
   float scale = context.getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density;
   return (int) (pixels * scale + 0.5f);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hello guys...</p>

<p>I'm working on a Flex 4 application and I started customizing the interface with skins to give a whole new look.</p>

<p>So, I've created two scrollbar skins in Flash Catalyst (one horizontal, one vertical).</p>

<p>Its working great when I test the application through Catalyst so I took it and imported it on Flash Builder, copied the components and defined the new skins in my css file for the HScrollbar and VScrollbar.</p>

<p>The skin is working, all the buttons are ok. But, the scrollbar isnt resizing for some reason. It remains in the same height I've designed it to be regardless of the content it is bound to.</p>

<p>It scrolls the content in all the ways it should be but it doesnt resize and the thumb isnt getting all the way down.</p>

<p>Also I've noticed the following.</p>

<p>I have a custom component acting as a list. It extends Group and contains a Scroller. So at one place of the application the Scrollthumb is getting lower than on another place where the same custom list is used.</p>

<p>I also have to mention that this scroller works perfectly without a custom skin.</p>

<p>Anyone else having similar problems?</p>

<p>I've spent most of my career writing applications for consumption within small to medium sized organizations.  In those roles, I'd relied on regular expressions to validate the user's input (e.g. email, zipcode, phone # or to find and remove unwanted markup) and the  AntiXSS library to protected against cross site scripting attacks.</p>

<p>After reading (ok, trolling) through the posts here, and after reading them I'm wondering that if what I am currently doing is enough, especially as more of my projects are becoming more outward facing.  </p>

<p>My question is this:  Is there are good tutorial with examples on best practices to sanitize user input?  I found this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa973813.aspx" rel="nofollow">article</a> and this which deals with the XSS library and this <a href="http://refactormycode.com/codes/333-sanitize-html" rel="nofollow">thread</a> on RefactorMyCode - I don't want to rely on just one facet to protect the site.</p>

<p>Any help/advice would be useful.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>function stripmore($in)
{
    list($p1,$p2) = explode("read_more()",$in,2);

    $pass1 = preg_replace("~&gt;[^&lt;&gt;]+&lt;~","&gt;&lt;",$p2);
    $pass2 = preg_replace("~^[^&lt;&gt;]+~","",$pass1);

    $pass3 = null;
    while ( $pass3 != $pass2 )
    {
        if ( $pass3 !== null ) $pass2 = $pass3;
        $pass3 = preg_replace("~&lt;([^&lt;&gt;]+)&gt;&lt;/\\1&gt;~","",$pass2);
    }

    return $p1."read_more()".$pass3;
}
</code></pre>

<p>this strips any non-html after the read_more() mark, and reduces it to the minimum by stripping corresponding tags, while keeping any tag starting before and ending after the mark:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Some text here. read_more()&lt;/p&gt;
      ==&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some text here. read_more()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt; read_more() &lt;b&gt;here&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      ==&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some &lt;b&gt;text&lt;/b&gt; read_more()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;b&gt;text read_more() here&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      ==&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some &lt;b&gt;text read_more()&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Why not use two textareas?  One above and below the cut?  The should make it obvious to the user what's going on, and eliminate the headache for you.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> want to use a token, you should choose something a bit more distinctive.  Maybe:  <code>&lt;!--full body cut--&gt;</code> which you can be somewhat more sure isn't actually content being mistaken for a token.</p>

<p>Anyhow, if you want to split the string on the token, you just need to figure out where your token <em>is</em> using <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.strpos.php" rel="nofollow"><code>strpos()</code></a> and then use <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.substr.php" rel="nofollow"><code>substr()</code></a> to chop off the first part.  Something like:</p>

<pre><code>$intro = substr($text, 0, strpos($string, $token));
</code></pre>

<p>Following that, run your <code>$intro</code> through <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/book.tidy.php" rel="nofollow">tidy</a> (PHP extension) to <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/tidy.cleanrepair.php" rel="nofollow">clean up the syntax</a> and then strip off the extra crap it adds in there.  (I think you can <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.str-replace.php" rel="nofollow">str_replace()</a> the extras with an empty string.)</p>

<p>The only correct option I currently see is writing your own context-free grammar HTML parser in PHP which will allow you to close the tags appropriately (simply by popping the stack when reaching read more() and for each pop adding a closing tag). <br /><br />
This is, however, a lot of work and this might work well for you:</p>

<pre><code>$stripped = strip_tags($input);
list($preview) = explode("read more()", $stripped);
</code></pre>

<p>You lose the HTML markup but it's dead easy to implement. And no possible XSS on your front page :)</p>

<p>Ok so I have a little test program here:</p>

<p>This is in my file that I load through gtk.Builder</p>

<pre><code>&lt;object class="GtkWindow" id="mainWindow"&gt;
    &lt;property name="default_width"&gt;500&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name="default_height"&gt;250&lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;signal name="delete_event" handler="endProgram" /&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then use this:</p>

<pre><code>def endProgram ():
    print "end";

rofl = gtk.Builder();

rofl.add_from_file("mainwindow.ui");
win = rofl.get_object("mainWindow");
rofl.connect_signals("mainWindow");
win.show_all();
gtk.main();
</code></pre>

<p>Yet when I go to run that it complains that I am missing a handler for the mainWindow object.
I have tried doing     rofl.connect_signals(win); as well</p>

<p>Yes indeed.  There is a non-standard, but recognized <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/The_autocomplete_attribute_and_web_documents_using_XHTML" rel="nofollow">autocomplete attribute</a> that can be applied to form elements.</p>

<p>Check in your HTML for something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="password" name="the-password" id="the-password" autocomplete="off"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It can also be set by Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>var thePassword = document.getElementById('the-password');
thePassword.setAttribute("autocomplete", "off"); 
</code></pre>

<p>Happstack 0.5 no longer requires any version of QuickCheck by default. If you opt to build the tests, then it uses QuickCheck 2.</p>

<p>We are trying CQRS and DDD and event sourcing. Let's say I have a customer update an email address, which fires out CustomerUpdatesEmailAddress Event, this goes through to my operational (write DB) and updates the tables. Our system is designed such there is an ETL process that runs which takes operational data and updates the database (this is a read database).Given that the ETL can do some heavy lifting based on email address being changed (Email address is just an example), how do we sync up reporting database (DataMart and the operational side) as the user wants to see the email address update immediately in the screen?</p>

<p>I use mysqli extension and bind the result to an object:</p>

<pre><code>class Item {
    public $id, $name;
    }
$Item = new Item;
$stmt-&gt;bind_result($Item-&gt;id, $Item-&gt;name);
</code></pre>

<p>Every call to <code>$stmt-&gt;fetch()</code> will overwrite $Item's properties which became references. If I simply clone the object — these references remain and both instances change simultaneously:</p>

<pre><code>object(Item)#1 (2) {
  ["id"]=&gt;
  &amp;int(1)
  ["name"]=&gt;
  &amp;string(4) "name"
}
</code></pre>

<p>So there should be a way to dereference them so <code>clone</code> really makes a copy, not a set of referenced data. Is there a simple, flexible way to retrieve all the data so it's stored as an array of objects? The main problem is how to remove the references: <code>&amp;string</code>.</p>

<p>The only solution I see is to instantiate another object and manually copy all the properties:</p>

<pre><code>$Item2 = new Item;
foreach ($Item as $prop =&gt; $val)
    $Item2-&gt;$prop = $val;
</code></pre>

<p>but this seems to be an overkill: it will copy all properties (including some extra ones which were not actually referenced) which is not necessary, and moreover — is a penalty to the performance.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>After working in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3349195/as3-how-to-show-just-the-last-line-of-dinamic-text-and-more">AS3, How to show just the last line of dinamic text (and more)</a>, I would like to know if it is possible to implement a <em>fade in - fade out</em>, or any other transition effect, to the dynamic text shown from the .txt external file, when the text changes on the movie. </p>

<p>TIA,</p>

<p>I don't care about perf for my usages (and you shouldn't either, unless you have a good reason to, and you find out via your profiler that this code is the bottleneck).</p>

<p>What I do is similar to functional's answer.  I use LINQ set operators to get the exception on each list:</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't notice this is Java.  Sorry, I'm off in C# la-la land, and they look very similar :)</p>

<p>Instead of using full HTML, why not use one of the many markup languages that can generate HTML, but which don't require you to close tags, etc.  It would be easier to train your users, and would avoid all of the possibilities for XSS attacks that accepting raw HTML allows.</p>

<p><a href="http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/" rel="nofollow">PHP Markdown</a> would seem an obvious fit, particularly in light of your desire to avoid the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>Per <a href="http://www.pygtk.org/docs/pygtk/class-gtkbuilder.html#method-gtkbuilder--connect-signals" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>, <code>connect_signals</code> takes as the argument a mapping or instance, and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>uses Python's introspective features
  to look at the keys (if object is a
  mapping) or attributes (if object is
  an instance) and tries to match them
  with the signal handler names given in
  the interface description. The
  callbacks referenced by each matched
  key or attribute are connected to
  their matching signals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for example when you pass <code>"mainwindow"</code>, which is an instance of <code>str</code>, the attributes are e.g. such method names as <code>upper</code>, <code>lower</code>, <code>isalpha</code>, and the like -- nothing to do with anything at all that you might be remotely interested about.  And why would you want the attributes of <code>win</code> to handle signals, either?  IOW, what do you expect <code>connect_signals</code> to <strong>do</strong>?</p>

<p>A more typical example use can be found e.g. in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2129369/gtk-builder-and-multiple-glade-files-breaks">SO question</a> and <a href="http://www.micahcarrick.com/gtk-glade-tutorial-part-3.html" rel="nofollow">this tutorial</a>, which offers among others the following Python example:</p>

<pre><code>class TutorialTextEditor:

    def on_window_destroy(self, widget, data=None):
        gtk.main_quit()

    def __init__(self):

        builder = gtk.Builder()
        builder.add_from_file("tutorial.xml") 

        self.window = builder.get_object("window")
        builder.connect_signals(self)     
</code></pre>

<p>as you see, here <code>connect_signals</code> is used in the typical way -- i.e., passing an object (<code>self</code>) with an <code>on_window_destroy</code> method that (by introspection) will be used as the handler for the signal raised on window destruction.</p>

<p>You may want to use a "slug" instead.  Rather than using the verbatim title as the URL, you <a href="http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.strtolower.php" rel="nofollow"><code>strtolower()</code></a> and replace all non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens, then remove duplicate hyphens.  If you feel like extra credit, you can strip out <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/fulltext-stopwords.html" rel="nofollow">stopwords</a>, too.</p>

<p>So "1-As Low As 10% Downpayment, Free Golf Membership!!!" becomes:</p>

<p><code>as-low-as-10-downpayment-free-gold-membership</code></p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>function sluggify($url)
{
    # Prep string with some basic normalization
    $url = strtolower($url);
    $url = strip_tags($url);
    $url = stripslashes($url);
    $url = html_entity_decode($url);

    # Remove quotes (can't, etc.)
    $url = str_replace('\'', '', $url);

    # Replace non-alpha numeric with hyphens
    $match = '/[^a-z0-9]+/';
    $replace = '-';
    $url = preg_replace($match, $replace, $url);

    $url = trim($url, '-');

    return $url;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could probably shorten it with longer regexps but it's pretty straightforward as-is.  The bonus is that you can use the same function to validate the query parameter before you run a query on the database to match the title, so someone can't stick silly things into your database.</p>

<p>Sorry, hashes don't work that way.  You aren't saving any memory by using a reference instead of a string as a hash key, and furthermore you are 1. making it harder to find data in the has (it is obscured) 2. getting in the way of Perl's internal hash optimizations (using a <em>hash algorithm</em> to provide O(1) lookup inside what is effectively a list).  In either case, the hash key is a <em>scalar</em>, which needs to be stored somewhere.  By using a reference as the hash key, now you not only need to store the reference in the hash, but also the value it is referencing, so you are now using <em>more</em> memory.</p>

<p>What led you to believe that you were saving memory by your, <em>cough</em>, novel approach? Have you run a memory profiler against different implementations?</p>

<p>Generally, you cannot get from a hash's <em>value</em> back to its <em>key</em> (although you could traverse the hash table linearly looking for it, if it were unique).  If you want to keep track of both a hash key and value, you need to do it yourself.  Some common approaches are:</p>

<pre><code># iterate through the table by key
foreach my $key (keys %hash)
{
     # here we have both the key and its corresponding value
     print "value at key $key is $hash{$key}\n";
}

# iterate through the table by keys and values
while (my ($key, $value) = each %hash)
{
     print "value at key $key is $value, which is the same as $hash{$key}\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>I made a new project in XCode (console application). Then I added a new Objective-C class and compiled it. However, it wouldn't build. Here are the errors I am seeing:</p>

<pre><code>Undefined symbols:
  "_objc_msgSendSuper", referenced from:
      -[Terminal init] in Terminal.o
      -[Terminal dealloc] in Terminal.o
  ".objc_class_name_NSObject", referenced from:
      .objc_class_name_Terminal in Terminal.o
ld: symbol(s) not found
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
</code></pre>

<p>Terminal is the name of the new class that I added. Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>An alternative is to store your value as an integer number of cents (which is always an exact amount, no rounding), and then convert to dollars when displaying for reports using divmod:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; value_in_cents = 133
&gt;&gt;&gt; print "$%d.%d" % divmod(value_in_cents,100)
$1.33
</code></pre>

<p>The way I see it, the components in Flex and the ability to create a custom component that fits your exact needs (and all of this is done by a fully object oriented approach) cant be matched by the AJAX frameworks. The AMF protocol is also a big advantage since its amazingly fast. The animations are easily created to give each component a feeling that enhances the user experience and can give to your interface a life of its own. Everything mentioned before my post also should be considered.</p>

<p>The open source solutions are there to use them whenever its right, and I would also use it if I wanted to build a simple site with some server side code perhaps.</p>

<p>But when you pass from the "website" and get to the "web application" then I think that in order to be successful you have to create material that stands out. Flex is there exactly for that.</p>

<p>If you can build the same experience without it go ahead and do it, good for you. :)</p>

<p>No. This is because Silverlight (like Flash) thinks of itself as an "application", not a "document". There's a lot of banter on this subject of <a href="http://cwilso.com/2008/07/23/fonts-embedding-vs-linking/" rel="nofollow">font embedding vs. linking</a> and <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2008/08/the_coming_batt.html" rel="nofollow">web fonts</a>. Silverlight incorrectly uses the word "embed" where it actually "links" instead.</p>

<p>Like any good technology though, it may be possible to reverse engineer an EOT file though - these security guys did it using IE: <a href="http://securitylabs.websense.com/content/Blogs/3114.aspx" rel="nofollow">Reverse Engineering the Embedded OpenType Decompression</a>. I don't think would be illegal in any way as the compression/decompression is a submission to W3C on <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/2008/SUBM-MTX-20080305/" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/Submission/2008/SUBM-MTX-20080305/</a> (although it may make the font foundries a little angry). Or maybe you could look at this ttf-to-eot converter and do the reverse: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ttf2eot/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/ttf2eot/</a></p>

<p>Anyway, you have a lot of work ahead of you if you want to go down this path.</p>

<p>You can do</p>

<pre><code>Process.Start("cmd.exe");
</code></pre>

<p>as many times as you would like. Is this what you mean?</p>

<p>I spent a fair amount of time trying to determine why my view of a site didn't match a clients, after looking at the cache etc. we determined the problem to be with one of the add-ons (Adblock Plus in this particular case). It would have been much simpler if we could have had an easy way to query what add-ons were installed, and ideally active. Is there anyway to generate a list programmatically perhaps with JavaScript?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Steve</p>

<p>Sounds like you didn't link with the Cocoa framework (C console programs don't do it by default). Right-click your project, go to "Add", and select "Existing Frameworks..." Find <code>Cocoa.framework</code> in there and build again.</p>

<p>Is there a mysql query to find and replace parts of field names? </p>

<p>I know you can do that within the actual data using </p>

<pre><code>update [table_name] 
   set [field_name] = replace([field_name],'[string_to_find]','[string_to_replace]');

<p>... but how do you do that for the actual field names?</p>

<p>I have some fields with a <code>-</code> in the name, and I'd like to replace them all with a <code>_</code></p>

<p>I'm working on a project in PHP that needs to render dynamically-created SVG images to PNG (or GIF if not PNG) format.  I know I can do this by invoking a SVG renderer like rsvg, or with an extension like ImageMagick, which isn't that common*.</p>

<p>Is there a "drop-in" style library that can render SVG using things like GD and DomDocument?</p>

<p>* Available in common webhosts and in packages like <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" rel="nofollow">XAMPP</a>.</p>

<p>To clarify, I already have the SVG itself generated, I just need it to be rendered server-size.</p>

<p>In order to answer a comment to my comment I decided to have it be an answer, so I can take advantage of the markup options.</p>

<p>Why can't you just use trim() on the resulting string, find the missing open or close element and append that appropriately, to make it valid HTML? </p>

<p>Just traverse forward and back to find the next open/close element, and fix your HTML. </p>

<p>So, you can just walk forward and back in the string to get the next <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>, and if that is an HTML element then stop there, otherwise keep going.</p>

<p>Ideally you should need to process this once per submission, so you keep paying the price to do this operation.</p>

<p>I have the same problem as the user in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1269722/selecting-text-on-focus-using-jquery-not-working-in-safari-and-chrome" title="Selecting text on focus using jQuery not working in Safari and Chrome">this question</a>, which is due to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4505" rel="nofollow">this bug</a> in Webkit. However, the workaround provided will not work for my app. Let me re-state the problem so that you don't have to go read another question:</p>

<p>I am trying to select all the text in a textarea when it gets focus. The following jQuery code works in IE/FF/Opera:</p>

<pre><code>$('#out').focus(function(){
  $('#out').select();
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, in Chrome/Safari the text is selected--very briefly--but then the mouseUp event is fired and the text is deselected. The following workaround is offered in the above links:</p>

<pre><code>$('#out').mouseup(function(e){
  e.preventDefault();
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, <strong>this workaround is no good for me</strong>. I want to select all text <em>only</em> when the user gives the textarea focus. He <em>must</em> then be able to select only part of the text if he chooses. Can anyone think of a workaround that still meets this requirement?</p>

<p>This will be used in my community website (forum, articles) where some users post very large image.</p>

<p>I can auto-resize the images using below codes</p>

<pre><code>#post img {
    max-height: 1000px;
    max-width: 700px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But one more, I want (on every resized image) a link created to that image URL. So when visitor click the link, they can see the image actual size.</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, you are trying to heuristically extract URLs from HTML files, from both attributes (e.g. "href") and text.</p>

<ul>
<li>You want it to work with malformed HTML</li>
<li>You want it to work with malformed URLs; e.g. URLs containing spaces</li>
<li>You don't want it to make any mistakes; e.g. your example.</li>
</ul>

<p>I put it to you that your requirements are impossible.  For example, what <em>should</em> be extracted from the following text:</p>

<pre><code>Go to the URL http://example.com/ this and that.  And if that doesn't work, 
I recommend that you go read the http specification.
</code></pre>

<p>Is "this and that" supposed to be part of the URL, or not?  And how is your software supposed to figure this out?  And what if the author of the document meant the opposite to what your heuristic says?  And what about "http specification" ... which is clearly NOT a URL.</p>

<p>And here's another, slightly more subtle example:</p>

<pre><code>First, go to the URL http://example.com/index.html.
Then click on the "login" link.
</code></pre>

<p>Should your software extract "http://example.com/index.html." or "http://example.com/index.html"?  According to the URL specification, both are valid URLs.  Your software would probably strip off the final "." because it is most likely to be punctuation, but it <em>might</em> be wrong.</p>

<p>My advice:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't think you can do a better job than an existing permissive HTML parser.  Where you are coming from, the chances that you can are close to zero.</li>
<li>Don't think that your software won't make mistakes.  100% accuracy requires that your software can read the mind of the person who created the file.  (And arguably, even that is not sufficient.)</li>
<li>Pay attention to the context in which URLs appear.  You need to use different heuristics to extract URLs from HTML attributes and text.</li>
<li>Pay attention to exactly what is, and what is not a legal URL.</li>
<li>Fully read and understand all relevant parts of the HTML and URL/URI specifications.  While it is kind of OK to make mistakes with malformed documents, it would be unforgivable to fail to extract well-formed URLs from attributes of well-formed HTML documents.</li>
</ol>

<p>BR,
Martin</p>

<p>Remember that the primary use of C++/CLI is for developing class libraries for consumption by GUIs / web services built in other .NET languages.  So C++/CLI has to support both reference and value types because other .NET languages do.</p>

<p>Furthermore, C# can have <code>ref</code> parameters that are value typed as well, this isn't unique to C++/CLI and it doesn't in any way make value types equivalent to reference types.</p>

<p>To answer the questions in your code comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>am I creating a copy or what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, SetValueTwo takes its parameter by value, so a copy is made.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>is this copy Disposable even though value types don't have destructors?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  Value types can have destructors.  Value types cannot have finalizers.  Since this particular value type has a trivial destructor, the C++/CLI compiler will not cause it to implement IDisposable.  In any case, if a parameter is an IDisposable value type, the C++/CLI compiler will ensure that Dispose is called when the variable goes out of scope, just like stack semantics for local variables.  This includes abnormal termination (thrown exception), and allows managed types to be used with RAII.</p>

<p>Both</p>

<pre><code>ValueStruct% ref = *gcnew ValueStruct;
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>ValueStruct^ ref = gcnew ValueStruct;
</code></pre>

<p>are allowed, and put a boxed value type instance on the managed heap (which isn't a heap at all, but a stack, however it is not the call stack where local variables are stored, so Microsoft chooses to call it a heap like the native memory area for dynamic allocation).</p>

<p>Unlike C#, C++/CLI can keep typed handles to boxed objects.</p>

<p>If a tracking reference is to a value type instance on the stack or embedded in another object, then the value type content has to be boxed in the process of formed the reference.</p>

<p>Tracking references can also be used with reference types, and the syntax to obtain a handle is the same:</p>

<pre><code>RefClass^ newinst = gcnew RefClass();
RefClass% reftoinst = *newinst;
RefClass^% reftohandle = newinst;

RefClass stacksem;
RefClass^ ssh = %stacksem;
</code></pre>

<p>One thing that I can never seem to remember completely is that the syntax isn't 100% consistent compared to native C++.</p>

<p>Declare a reference:</p>

<pre><code>int&amp; ri = i; // native
DateTime% dtr = dt; // managed tracking reference
</code></pre>

<p>Declare a pointer:
    int* pi; // native
    Stream^ sh; // tracking handle</p>

<p>Form a pointer:
    int* pi = &ri; // address-of native object
    DateTime^ dth = %dtr; // address-of managed object</p>

<p>Note that the unary address-of operator is the same as the pointer notation in both standard C++ and C++/CLI.  This seems to contradict <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9zekbcac.aspx" rel="nofollow">a tracking reference cannot be used as a unary take-address operator (MSDN)</a> which I'll get back to in a second.</p>

<p>First though, the inconsistency:</p>

<p>Form a reference from a pointer:
    int&amp; iref = *pi;
    DateTime% dtref = *dth;</p>

<p>Note that the unary dereference operator is always <code>*</code>.  It is the same as the reference notation only in the native world, which is completely opposite of references which, as mentioned above, are always the same symbol as the pointer notation.</p>

<p>Compilable example:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime^ dth = gcnew DateTime();
DateTime% dtr = *dth;

DateTime dt = DateTime::Now;
DateTime^ dtbox = %dt;

FileInfo fi("temp.txt");
// FileInfo^ fih = &amp;fi;  causes error C3072
FileInfo^ fih = %fi;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, about unary address-of:</p>

<p>First, the MSDN article is wrong when it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following sample shows that a tracking reference cannot be used as a unary take-address operator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The correct statement is:</p>

<p><strong><code>%</code> is the address-of operator for creation of a tracking handle.  However its use is limited as follows:</strong></p>

<p>A tracking handle must point to an object on the managed heap.  Reference types always exist on the managed heap so there is no problem.  However, value types and native types may be on the stack (for local variables) or embedded within another object (member variables of value type).  Attempts to form a tracking handle will form a handle to a boxed copy of the variable: the handle is not linked to the original variable.  As a consequence of the boxing process, which requires metadata which does not exist for native types, it is never possible to have a tracking handle to an instance of a native type.</p>

<p>Example code:</p>

<pre><code>int i = 5;
// int^ ih = %i;  causes error C3071

System::Int32 si = 5;
// System::Int32^ sih = %si; causes error C3071
// error C3071: operator '%' can only be applied to an instance 
//              of a ref class or a value-type
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>System::Int32</code> isn't a value type then I don't know what is.  Let's try <code>System::DateTime</code> which is a non-primitive value type:</p>

<pre><code>DateTime dt = DateTime::Now;
DateTime^ dtbox = %dt;
</code></pre>

<p>This works!</p>

<p>As a further unfortunate restriction, primitive types which have dual identity (e.g. native <code>int</code> and managed value type <code>System::Int32</code>) are not handled correctly, the <code>%</code> (form tracking reference) operator cannot perform boxing <em>even when the .NET name for the type is given</em>.</p>

<p>Make a <code>bool</code>. Set it to <code>true</code> after a focus event and reset it after a mouse up event. During the mouse up, if it's <code>true</code>, you know the user just selected the text field; therefore you know you must prevent the mouse up from happening. Otherwise, you must let it pass.</p>

<pre><code>var textFieldGotFocus = false;

$('#out').focus(function()
{
    $('#out').select();
    textFieldGotFocus = true;
});

$('#out').mouseup(function(e)
{
    if (textFieldGotFocus)
        e.preventDefault();
});

$(document).mouseup(function() { textFieldGotFocus = false; });
</code></pre>

<p>It's important that you put the mouseup listener that resets the variable on <code>document</code>, since it's not guaranteed that the user will release the mouse button over the text field.</p>

<p>I have installed the WAMP server on my local machine, and would like to use it in "Put Online" mode to share the work with clients.  I have it working with the IP address, but when I click on a PHP file in the localhost, the basic HTML displays, but the CSS doesn't seem to work.  The CSS is connected through a relative path, but it won't display the styles.</p>

<p>I have set up WAMP to display multiple websites within the www/ folder.  I didn't know if this had something to do with it or not. </p>

<p>Any help on this matter would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>When in doubt, MSDN generally has good info:

<p>Basically, AntiXSS is pretty solid (nothing is perfect) for XSS attack prevention.</p>

<p>For SQL query protection, look at using parametrized queries..and even then, run them through a regex or two if you have the cycles :-)</p>

<p>This wiki has a bit different info about regex than anything in your post or mine thus far:</p>

<p>This article has an interesting VB function you could convert for ASP for checking a string for SQL injection.  No promises on if it's effective.  <a href="http://aspalliance.com/1703_SQL_Injection_in_Classic_ASP_and_Possible_Solutions.3" rel="nofollow">http://aspalliance.com/1703_SQL_Injection_in_Classic_ASP_and_Possible_Solutions.3</a></p>

<p>You can click the "persist" button on the net tab. (and other tabs)  Was a real "oh duh" moment for me when I noticed it.</p>

<p>Sure, not a problem.  You can use position: absolute to move a link up over the image:</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="img"&gt;
    &lt;img src="your-img.jpg"/&gt;
    &lt;a href="your-img.jpg" class="full-size"&gt;View Full Sized&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>CSS</strong></p>

<pre><code>#post .img {
   position: relative;
}

#post img {
   max-height: 1000px;
   max-width: 700px;

   position: relative;
   z-index: 1;
}

#post a.full-size {
   position: absolute;
   z-index: 2;

   /* Change this to move the link around */
   top: 0px;
   left: 0px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The reason you need the extra <code>&lt;div class="img"&gt;</code> is so there's a relatively positioned parent for the absolutely positioned link.  This causes the link to use its parent as its coordinate system, rather than the document.</p>

<p>I have a very simple image upload web app. There's only upload and image crop. Everything worked fine. I have not made any changes to the code or anything. Today I visit my site and the submit button has vanished. I thought maybe I was hacked. I tried the version of my site that I have on my own machine running in IIS and the button is also missing. How could the submit button just vanish? I even tested other versions of my site I had saved and stored in rar files on my computer. Any idea of what happened? The web page is a .aspx page. The code for the button is still there. The same way it's always been. The graphic is still there. Now I'd maybe believe someone gained access to my server and did this as a joke but I also tested my site running in IIS on my own computer and I still got the same result. No submit button. So someone would have had to gained access to my server and computer and changed every copy of the site I saved on my computer too which doesn't seem likely to me. Only the submit button is gone. Everything else is fine.</p>

<p>Google will modify any resource you give it by adding a random identifier to the end.</p>

<p>If you're writing both the sender and the receiver, try using an XMPP extension:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;message to="fred.bloggs@gmail.com"&gt;
  &lt;x xmlns='http://my.domain.example.com/my_extension'&gt;stuff&lt;/x&gt;
&lt;/message&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to be able to tell which of the resources is your client, try <a href="http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html" rel="nofollow">XEP-0115</a>.</p>

<p>You can do this simply with HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href='image.jpg'&gt;&lt;img src='image.jpg' alt='image'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When the user clicks on the image, it will take them to the original full-sized image.</p>

<p>Delete and reinstall the app. There's a bug where updated resources may not be installed when the app already exists on the device.</p>

<p>To change the column names, you'll need to use the ALTER TABLE command.</p>

<p>Here's a solution in pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>Get all table names
Foreach t in table names
  Foreach columnname in t containing '-'
    newname = old name with "-" replaced with "_"
    "ALTER TABLE &lt;tablename&gt; CHANGE &lt;columnname&gt; &lt;newname&gt;"
  End
End

<p>Say you have a Post model that has a <code>:title</code>, <code>:author</code>, <code>:content</code>, etc. It also has a <code>:thread_id</code> attribute, and it <code>belongs_to :thread</code>.</p>

<p>The thread model doesn't have any custom fields. The only ones you'll be needing are those created by default such as <code>:id</code>, <code>:created_at</code>, and <code>:updated_at</code>. Threads <code>have_many :posts</code>.</p>

<p>How do you create a form for a Thread that simultaneously creates both a Thread and a Post?</p>

<hr>

<p>Related questions, possibly:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I say <code>&lt;% form_for @new_thread ... %&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;% form_for @new_post ... %&gt;</code>?</li>
<li>Should the form be in the Thread view code or the Post view code?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for your help, I am new to Rails and I'm still learning how to organize my code in it.</p>

<p>I am using the Android SDK icon-button for refresh (ic_menu_refresh) in a widget and I need to change the selection state when it is pressed.  How is this done?  Do I define an XML for the button?</p>

<p>Hi, I have a mysql query as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *, MATCH(songtitle) AGAINST('{keyword}') as Relevance FROM links WHERE approved = "true" AND MATCH(songtitle) AGAINST('{keyword}' IN BOOLEAN MODE) ORDER BY Relevance DESC, score DESC LIMIT 5
</code></pre>

<p>This works generally as expected, but for certain queries it will not return the right results. It would appear to have to do with the length or alphanumeric makeup of the keyword used.</p>

<p>For example, I have a row where the value of songtitle is "Jay Z". I also have several containing the name "Jay Sean"</p>

<p>Searching for "Jay" or "Jay Z" does not return any of these results. Searching for "Jay Sean" has the expected and desired result.</p>

<p>I'm guessing this has something to do with the small amount of characters in "Jay" and "jay z"?</p>

<p>Any info out there about this?</p>

<p>Thanks!
Dave</p>

<p>Simply put - nope.  In MySQL you have to write a SP in their language or a UDF in <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/adding-udf.html" rel="nofollow">C/C++</a>. I brought up a C/C++ UDF, but I don't believe you can even really do a stored procedure in them.  </p>

<p>They don't support different languages via a pluggable system like PostgreSQL.</p>

<pre><code>import os
path= os.getcwd()
final= path +'\xulrunner.exe ' + path + '\application.ini'
print final
</code></pre>

<p>I want the out put:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>c:\python25\xulrunner.exe
  c:\python25\application.ini</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't want slash to work as string, i mean don't want it to escape or do anything special. But i get an error</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Invalid \x escape</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can i use a '\' as a '\' and not an escape?</p>

<p>I'm creating a custom module and I need to be able to read the html output that's written to the HttpResponse object. Can anyone provide direction on this?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I'm working on implementing bezier handles into my application. I have points and I need to figure out weather the current direction of the new point is clockwise or counter clockwise. This is because my bezier interpolation algorithm calculates the handles from right to left.</p>

<p>Therefore no matter what it interpolates:
P1 P1.righthandle P2 P2.lefthandle to achieve cubic bezier</p>

<p>How can I figure out if the shape is CW or CCW. Thanks</p>

<p>To answer your question directly, put <code>r</code> in front of the string.</p>

<pre><code>final= path + r'\xulrunner.exe ' + path + r'\application.ini'
</code></pre>

<p>But a better solution would be <code>os.path.join</code>:</p>

<pre><code>final = os.path.join(path, 'xulrunner.exe') + ' ' + \
         os.path.join(path, 'application.ini')
</code></pre>

<p>(the backslash there is escaping a newline, but you could put the whole thing on one line if you want)</p>

<p>I will mention that you can use forward slashes in file paths, and Python will automatically convert them to the correct separator (backslash on Windows) as necessary. So</p>

<pre><code>final = path + '/xulrunner.exe ' + path + '/application.ini'
</code></pre>

<p>should work. But it's still preferable to use <code>os.path.join</code> because that makes it clear what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>G'day,</p>

<p>I'm trying to update part of a VBO with a call to glBufferSubData(). When I update from the start (0) of my existing shadow buffer, there is no problem, as the buffer starts reading from 0. The following will read 0 to y from the buffer and place it at 0 to y in the VBO:</p>

<pre><code>gl.glBufferSubData(GL11.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0, y, mPositionBuffer);
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I want to update a portion of the VBO (not from 0) I run into a problem; The following doesn't work, since it will write the values from the start of the buffer (0 to y) into position x to x+y of the VBO:</p>

<pre><code>gl.glBufferSubData(GL11.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, x, y, mPositionBuffer);
</code></pre>

<p>Changing the position using buffer.position(x) does not have any effect:</p>

<pre><code>gl.glBufferSubData(GL11.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, x, y, mPositionBuffer.position(x));
</code></pre>

<p>A solution is to slice() the buffer, which works great:</p>

<pre><code>mPositionBuffer.position(x);
gl.glBufferSubData(GL11.GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, x, y, mPositionBuffer.slice());
</code></pre>

<p>But this causes garbage since a new buffer is generated by using slice, even though it uses the same data store.</p>

<p>The question: Is there a way to get the desired result (replace an offset part of a VBO using an offset into a buffer) without generating garbage? As you probably guessed, this is for an android game and in-game garbage collection is a no-no.</p>

<p>Thanks! Aert.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be too hard to do yourself.  SVG is a fairly simple specification, so there shouldn't be too much guess work building a converter...  The only difficult parts that I can see would be gradients, markers and filters.  The rest should be relatively straight forward when looking at the gd functions available.</p>

<p>Obviously, the best would be to find a stand alone library, but if you can't you could always roll one yourself...</p>

<p>No. This is sort of the modern day late-binding.</p>

<p>A hash is a means of associating names with scalars. If you have a hash and a key, you have a scalar, not a reference to a hash bucket or anything like that. </p>

<pre><code>my $value = $hash{name};
</code></pre>

<p>Is just a scalar.</p>

<pre><code>my $ref = \$hash{name};
</code></pre>

<p>Is just a reference to a scalar. No more capable of containing information that allows you to back trace to a hash key than an anonymous reference can tell you what the name might be on the symbol table, or the lexical pad (without some help). </p>

<p>It's not natively a part of Bing Maps - you have to program it in yourself. But from the looks of it, it appears all you need is an algorithm to determine the width/height and angle of the foot print (well, probably the darkness instead) and then just have an animation on a path geometry to move it.</p>

<p>Could anybody suggest a good open source (as in I can see the source, license irrelevant) webkit-sharp-based application?

I thought a good application example is as good as any documentation.</p>

<p>I have  created a compiler in C (using lex &amp; bison) for a dynamic typed programming language that supports loops, functions declarations inside functions, recursive calls etc. I also created a virtual machine for that runs the intermediate code created by the compiler.</p>

<p>I was now  thinking instead of compiling to my own intermediate code, compile it to java byte code.                                     </p>

<p>I saw that the question about creating a JVM language has already been <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/716613/how-to-make-a-net-or-jvm-language">asked</a> but I don't find the answer very informative.</p>

<p>So here are my questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>I guess to create a language for JVM a must is to read the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second_edition/html/VMSpecTOC.doc.html" rel="nofollow">JVM specification</a> book, what other books can you suggest (except Dragon Book of course)? I'm mostly concerned in books or tutorials on how to create a JVM language, not a compiler in general.</li>
<li>There are many Java libraries to read, write and change .class files like <a href="http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jclasslib/overview.html" rel="nofollow">jclasslib</a>, <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/" rel="nofollow">bcel</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/api/gnu/bytecode/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow">gnu bytecode</a>, etc. Which one would you suggest? Also, are you aware of C libraries that do the same job?</li>
<li>I was thinking to have a look at maybe another language that targets the JVM like Clojure, Jython or JRuby. But all these languages are very high level and complicated (to create a compiler for them). I was looking for a simpler (I don't mind it it's unknown or unused) programming language that targets the JVM and it's compiler is open source. Any ideas?</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><p>A reference is not an integer; it's an SV, so it's going to be something like 24 bytes, not 4.</p></li>
<li><p>Not that it matters, because you're not <em>storing</em> references, because <strong>hash keys are always strings</strong>. The keys of your <code>%group1</code> etc. hashes are actually strings that look like "HASH(0x19838e2)", which is useless.</p></li>
<li><p>Not that it matters, because Perl is smart enough to avoid wasting memory if the same strings are used as keys in multiple hashes. That's right, if you just did things the simple, obvious, sensible way, perl would use <em>less memory</em> than it does with the complicated thing you're trying to do.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You have your original angle, the last known angle (since I'm sure you're redrawing the handle as it's being dragged), and the current angle.  I'd take a look at the last known handle angle on the last redraw and compare whether the new angle, relative to that is > 180 degrees or &lt; 180 degrees.  If it's 0 - 180 degrees, it's moving in a clockwise direction, and if it's 180 - 360 degrees, it's moving in a counterclockwise direction.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p><em>Is there any way to make a function call only once?</em></p>

<p>Suppose I have some class </p>

<pre><code>struct A {

   void MainRoutine(Params) {
      // Want to call other routine only once
   }

   void OtherRoutine(Params) {

   }
};   
</code></pre>

<p>I want to call <code>OtherRoutine</code> only once in <code>MainRoutine</code> (I assume that <code>MainRoutine</code> is going to be called <code>N</code> times. I can't call <code>OtherRoutine</code> from the constructor, because it accepts <code>Params</code> which may not be available at the time when object is being constructed.</p>

<p>Basically I want to do something like</p>

<p>As you said to create Tiled Pyramidal TIFF command is "vips im_vips2tiff source_image output_image.tif:none,tile:256x256,pyramid". It does not work with BigTiff image. I have tried it on 30GB Tiff file, it did not work.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea how to make it work on huge tiff images?</p>

<p>Thanks,

<p>please give more details, what code did you add? test your mouse events with a trace() statement, that may give you some form of idea of what's missing.</p>

<p>I'm an intermediate PHP developer with no experience building a large scale web application in this language (though I have in others, mainly Rails)...say I wanted to build a social networking site using PHP and MYSQL (preferably) with all the web 2.0 trimmings.  </p>

<p>Where should I start? What sort of frameworks should I be looking at? Any up to date modern books that would outline something like this? Really anything for building a modern web app in PHP.</p>

<p>I have to pass a value into a method that required a char *</p>

<pre><code>MyMethod(char * parameter)
{
    // code
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the parameter I need to feed it is currently a std::string. How do I convert the std::string to a char *?</p>

<pre><code>std::string myStringParameter = //whatever

char * myCharParameter = //Convert here somehow

MyMethod(myCharParameter);
</code></pre>

<p>You can also put the call-only-once logic, which you already outlined, inside <code>OtherRoutine</code>, causing it to return early if it has already been executed before.</p>

<p>Logically, its pretty much the same.  Stylistically, it might be nicer.</p>

<p>No, you can't do this with user/page JavaScript.  I imagine it would be a security risk, if you could.</p>

<p>But there is an add-on you can install that will generate a printable, copyable list of installed extensions/Add-ons.</p>

<p>Check out: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3746/" rel="nofollow">"Extension List Dumper"</a>.</p>

<p>You are looking for the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/c_str/" rel="nofollow">c_str()</a> method:</p>

<pre><code>char * myCharParameter = myStringParameter.c_str();
</code></pre>

<p>You might need to <code>const_cast</code> the return to get it into a <code>char *</code> instead of a <code>const char *</code>. Refrain from modifying the string though; it is the internal buffer of the <code>std::string</code> object. If you actually need to modify the string, you should use <code>strncpy</code> to copy it to another buffer:</p>

<pre><code>char * myCharParameter = new char[myStringParameter.length() + 1];
strncpy(myCharParameter, myStringParameter.c_str(), myStringParameter.length() + 1);

// And later...
myStringParameter.assign(myCharParameter);
delete [] myCharParameter;
</code></pre>

<p>You'll either need to run several processes (as above) or hook somehow into libvlc and instruct it to start up several players.</p>

<p>A good demo of this is the python wrapper to libvlc--I think--it shows how to sample to know where the stream is--however I've never tried it with multiple things running at the same time but I think it would work. </p>

<p>I avoid the "control" key, AKA <code>&lt;C&gt;</code> in vim parlance, on my laptop; I hate where Apple put it. I would really like to remap all of the vim commands using control to instead use "command", but this does not seem possible on a Mac, despite what I have read. I have read that I should use <code>&lt;Leader&gt;</code> to set such mappings, but I want to avoid remapping every single <code>&lt;C&gt;</code> mapping that I can find or think of in my .vimrc, just to forget some and bloat my .vimrc.</p>

<p>I want to avoid xmodmap or solutions beyond the scope of .vimrc, as I want to maintain compatibility of my config files that I sync across systems.</p>

<p>What I really want to do is specify an alternate key (probably <code>,</code>) as a modifier key equivalent to <code>&lt;C&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Could not find the answer to this. Looks like if text and images are user together, they do not have smooth effect. I have updated my question and provided the answer. Try increasing speed and time property. </p>

<p>Hello,
  In Pro JPA 2 (Apress) book, I have seen examples like,</p>

<pre><code>EntityManager em;
Long count = em.createNamedQuery(countQueryName, Long.class).getSingleResult();
</code></pre>

<p>But, the <a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html" rel="nofollow">api</a> , hopefully applied to JPA 2.0, shows the syntax as </p>

<pre><code>createNamedQuery(String name) 
Parameters:
name - the name of a query defined in metadata
</code></pre>

<p>with a single parameter. The book uses the type extensively, so what am I missing?</p>

<p>thanks.</p>

<p>I think the place to start is to really understand the fundamentals of HTTP and the tools PHP gives you for dealing with its stateless nature.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I would look into templating. <a href="http://www.smarty.net/" rel="nofollow">Perhaps Smarty?</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately really the only API vlc has is the command line or equivalent of the command line (you can start player instances, passing them essentially what you would have on the command line).  You can use libvlc if you need multiple instances or callbacks but it's pretty opaque still...</p>

<p>Sorry, I asked this question and forgot about it.</p>

<p>There were actually two problems. </p>

<p>The first is that xperf was actually using an older cached version of my symbols. This was fixed by deleting it from the symbol cache.</p>

<p>The second was that when I loaded symbols in xperfview, it didn't actually put my up-to-date pdb into the symbols cache. The pdb was in a directory that I confirmed was included in the _NT_SYMBOL_PATH variable, however. Unfortunately, I don't remember the exact command used to fix this, but I believe it was an '<em>xperf file.etl -symbols</em>' variant. This command correctly parsed the etl and loaded/cached all of the relevant symbols as it encountered them. After this, xperfview could correctly show my symbols.</p>

<p>Note that I had to re-run the command any time my pdb changed, because xperfview still wouldn't touch anything that wasn't already in the symbol cache. I'm still not sure why it behaves this way on my machine, other people don't seem to have this problem.</p>

<p>What was the original historical use of the vertical tab character (\v in the C language, ASCII 11)?</p>

<p>Did it ever have a key on a keyboard? How did someone generate it?</p>

<p>Is there any language or system still in use today where the vertical tab character does something interesting and useful?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm listening to the UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification in order to adjust my UI based on the device's orientation. </p>

<p>The problem is that the device orientation I'm getting from the notification seems inaccurate. If I start with the phone in portrait orientation and vertical (as if taking a picture with it) the orientation I get from the notification is correct. As the tilt of the phone approaches horizontal (as in laying flat on a table top) the orientation switches to landscape. This happens much before the phone is actually flat on the table. And this is without rotating the phone towards landscape at all. Is as if it had a preference for landscape. </p>

<p>When using other apps, like mail, I don't see this same behavior. It seems that mail only switches orientation once it's really sure you've gone to the new orientation.</p>

<p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I'd most probably use the following:</p>

<pre><code>f xs = foldr g (k (last xs)) (init xs)
</code></pre>

<p>It basically means that the end of the list is replaced by <code>k x</code> when folding. Thanks to lazy evaluation present everywhere, it works even for infinite lists.</p>

<p>There are two other solutions - adding empty case and using Maybe.</p>

<p>A) adding empty case:</p>

<p>It would be best if <code>f []</code> was well-defined. Then, you could write the definition as</p>

<pre><code>f [] = c
f (x:xs) = g x (f xs)
</code></pre>

<p>which is <code>f = foldr g c</code>. For example, if you change</p>

<pre><code>data Tableau = N Expr | S Expr Tableau | B Expr Tableau Tableau
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>data Tableau = N | S Expr Tableau | B Expr Tableau Tableau
</code></pre>

<p>then you can represent single-element tableaux as <code>S expr N</code>, and the function is defined as one-liner</p>

<pre><code>f = foldr S N
</code></pre>

<p>It's the best solution as long the empty case makes sense.</p>

<p>B) use Maybe:</p>

<p>On the other hand, if <code>f []</code> cannot be sensibly defined, it's worse. 
Partial functions are often considered ugly. To make it total, you can use <code>Maybe</code>. Define</p>

<pre><code> f [] = Nothing
 f [x] = Just (k x)
 f (x:xs) = Just (g x w)
            where Just w = f xs
</code></pre>

<p>It is a total function - that's better.</p>

<p>But now you can rewrite the function into:</p>

<pre><code> f [] = Nothing
 f (x:xs) = case f xs of
              Nothing -&gt; Just (k x)
              Just w -&gt; Just (g x w)
</code></pre>

<p>which is a right fold:</p>

<pre><code> addElement :: Expr -&gt; Maybe Tableaux -&gt; Maybe Tableaux
 addElement x Nothing = Just (N x)
 addElement x (Just w) = Just (S x w)

 f = foldr addElement Nothing
</code></pre>

<p>In general, folding is idiomatic and should be used when you fit the recursion pattern. Otherwise use explicit recursion or try to reuse existing combinators. If there's a new pattern, make a combinator, but only if you'll use the pattern a lot - otherwise it's overkill. In this case, the pattern is fold for nonempty lists defined by: <code>data List a = End a | Cons a (List a)</code>.</p>

<p>Obviously, you need to install PL/Ruby. After that, you can write:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION ruby_max(int4, int4) RETURNS int4 AS '
    if args[0].to_i &gt; args[1].to_i
        return args[0]
    else
        return args[1]
    end
' LANGUAGE 'plruby';
</code></pre>

<p>Check its <a href="http://github.com/knu/postgresql-plruby" rel="nofollow">GitHub repository</a> for installation instructions.</p>

<p>On Vista, this worked:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>DOS: <code>del c:\user\dad\.android\debug.keystore</code></p></li>
<li><p>ECLIPSE: In Project, Clean the project. Close Eclipse. Re-open Eclipse.</p></li>
<li><p>ECLIPSE: Start the Emulator. Remove the Application from the emulator. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>You are good to go.</p>

Typically I start things going by using the GUI to see what it is using as parameters, then go from there.  There's no magic formula there, mate.</p>

<p>Hi guys. I need some help in explaining this behavior in SQL Server 2008. I have a simple c++ program that is running a query in a loop. Here is the pseudocode of the program.</p>

<pre><code>myTempid = 0;

while (1) {
  execQuery(select a.id 
             from a,b,c,d 
            where a.id = b.id 
              and b.id = c.id 
              and c.id = d.id 
              and id.id = myTempID)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here are some facts</p>

<ol>
<li>a,b,c are empty tables</li>
<li>d has about 5500 rows</li>
</ol>

<p>The query starts out taking '0msec' (i can see this from the profiler); but then after X number of iterations; it jumps to about 60msec and stays there. The X is variant; sometimes its 100.. sometimes 200. The weird thing is that once it makes the jump from 0 to 60msec; it just stays there no matter the myID.</p>

<p>To me it sounds like SQL Server is somehow 'de-caching' the query plan?? Does this make sense to anyone</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<pre><code>This is a list of directories which will be searched for runtime files:

<p>You were definitely on the right track already. You should put your static 'called' variable inside your struct... ahem: you should make it a class instead, make it private, and make sure the state of the static variable is queried inside of OtherRoutine. <strong>You should not make it more complicated than it needs to be</strong>. Using boost, or anything else for so simple a mechanism is just overkill. </p>

<p>You could achieve this with boost::function and bind. Assuming you want OtherRoutine only to be called once per object,</p>

<pre><code>struct A {
    A() {
        Routine = boost::bind(&amp;A::OtherRoutine, this); 
    }

    boost::function&lt;void()&gt; Routine;

private:
    void MainRoutine() {
        // Do stuff that should occur on every call
    }

    void OtherRoutine() {
        Routine = boost::bind(&amp;A::MainRoutine, this);
        // Do stuff that should only occur once
        MainRoutine();
    }
};

A foo;
foo.Routine(); // OtherRoutine is called
foo.Routine(); // Now all subsequent calls will go to MainRoutine
foo.Routine();
</code></pre>

<p>I would suggest doing what the other people have said, though. While this may look 'cleaner,' it's overly complicated when compared to the alternatives.</p>

<p>Vertical tab was used to speed up printer vertical movement.  Some printers used special tab belts with various tab spots.  This helped align content on forms.  VT to header space, fill in header, VT to body area, fill in lines, VT to form footer.  Generally it was coded in the program as a character constant. From the keyboard, it would be <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>K</kbd>. </p>

<p>I don't believe anyone would have a reason to use it any more.  Most forms are generated in a printer control language like postscript.</p>

<p>If you remove the properties folder in your asp.net mvc project it will work as described.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the behavior you are describing will not present itself when running under IIS (not that this is actually a solution).</p>

<p>IISExpress should help when it is released!</p>

<p>I would like to experiment with this more as I thought the route engine took precedence over file system objects, esp when you setup a wild card mapping.</p>

<p>It appears you can't without having to turn Option Strict off.
I'll research some more though.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>After going through some documentation on the <code>ExpandoObject</code>, it appears it is used in C# for COM and Office Interop. Traditionally, in VB.NET, the <code>Object</code> was used for such purposes and that would require you turn off Option Strict.</p>

<p>To answer your question this means that you can use dynamic types in VB.NET by using the <code>Object</code> type instead of the <code>ExpandoObject</code> [if such a type exists in VB.NET], set <code>Option Infer On</code> and <strong>Option Infer On or Off</strong>.<br/>
You could also consider using partial classes to localise your non Option Strict code to particular files.

<p>No.  If the Oracle stored procedure is in PL/SQL you must convert your ArrayList (or any List implementation) into an array.</p>

<p>If your stored procedure is written in Java, you could serialize your ArrayList, send the byte stream to Oracle as a long string, and reconstitute it on the Oracle side.  I did this about 10 years ago for a client and it worked very well.  There are limits on how long a string you can pass across the Java-Oracle interface so if your data structure is large you will have to divide it into chunks that will fit into a single parameter, and have the Java on the Oracle side accept multiple long string parameters.</p>

<p>I'm trying to play with the erb templating in Ruby. It works fine at home - Apache on windows. But when I upload it to the server it breaks every time... Simple example:</p>

<pre><code>require "erb"

class Stuff
    def initialize( name )
        @name = name
    end

    def get_binding
        binding
    end
end

template = %{
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;%= @name %&gt;&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;Nothing to see here&lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
}

rhtml = ERB.new(template)
foo = Stuff.new("Hello")
puts "Content-type: text/html\n\n"
rhtml.run(foo.get_binding)
</code></pre>

<p>This does what I expect on my home server, but on the remote server I get a compile error. It always seems to appear when I try to evaluate any Ruby expression. From the server logs of generated code:</p>

<pre><code>template = %{
\t&lt;html&gt;
\t\t&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;%= @name ; print "&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\\n"

<p>Been banging my head into the wall for a while on this. I think it's time to ask the experts...</p>

<p>I have a Sql Server 2005 table with following data:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NRP7d.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>idHearing is the primary key (identity), idCase is a foreign key that may duplicate.  StartDate and StartTime specify the date and time of the event - both fields are of DateTime type (for whatever reason these are separate fields).  All StartDate data has a time of 12:00:00.  All StartTime data has a date of 1/1/1900.  IsScheduled and IsOnCalendar are bit fields.</p>

<p>My challenge is to select the latest (in terms of Date/Time) hearing for each idCase.  If the StartDate/StartTime are identical (as is in the rows 1 and 2), preference should be given to a row which has IsScheduled and/or IsCalendar on.  If those are columns are same as well, then it does not matter which row gets returned.</p>

<p>To make this more complicated, I must do it all in single SELECT statement (because it must be in a view) and I have to return all the columns that you see below.</p>

<p>I've tried several ways, but my SQL-FU isn't strong.  Any ideas?</p>

<p>the main difference between defaultTextFormat &amp; setTextFormat is when you actually apply the method. </p>

<p>Use defaultTextFormat when you format your TextField before defining your TextField text content, use setTextFormat when your Textfield text content has already been set. </p>

<p>In your code example, you don't mention when the text property is set. </p>

<p>Practically, if it works with one method, it should work with the other. It all depends on how you implement them</p>

<p>I see the following error when I start my rails app:</p>

<p>The notifications are just one way to get at it, you can also read out the accelerometer yourself and implement it in exactly the way you see fit (with a delay and a certain time of non-rotation for example).</p>

<p>Don't know if it's a power drain to get those readouts, but if so, use the notification to know when things are moving, and then fire up the accelometer-reading.</p>

<p>I have the python code... but how do i do it in c++?
I don't have much experience with c++. What i want is to make an exe that will be put as autorun in an cd. It has to open the application.ini file in my cd with xulrunner.exe in my cd. As the path will vary in each computer i hav to do something like this. </p>

<p>Make sure that your ListCollectionView itself isn't being created on a background thread.  I had this same problem and found that advice on <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/wpf/thread/410a0b39-dfdb-4115-8a68-4ccabc17bcb6" rel="nofollow">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/wpf/thread/410a0b39-dfdb-4115-8a68-4ccabc17bcb6</a>.

<p>There's no standard function to do this, so you'll need to compile different implementations for each platform you target.</p>

<p>On Windows, for example, you should use the temp directory, which can be obtained by a call to GetTempPath().</p>

<p>chmod the dir 755 or 775, you need execute access to the directory to be able to access it.</p>

<p>The correct function is diff if you're trying to calculate the difference of C between today and yesterday.</p>

<p>I'm not completely sure I understand what you're asking, but you may want the 'system' function. This will invoke the platform's command processor to execute the command given.</p>

<p>If all of your files (xulrunner.exe and application.ini) are in the same directory as the auto-run executable, you should be able to just rely on the working directory being correct and not need to give a full path.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>system("xulrunner.exe application.ini");

<p>It depends on the platform you're implementing it for, but on Windows (assuming from the C:\ that's where you are), you'll need to dip into the Windows API and use CreateProcess. On Linux, it would be system or popen (not terribly familiar there).</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425%28VS.85%29.aspx</a></p>

<p>If the EXE you're running is known to be in the current working directory (wherever your program is started from), you can simply use the filename ("xulrunner.exe") as the name. You may be safer with ".\xulrunner.exe", but that's more preference. You can also specify a subdirectory, or even SetCurrentDirectory to move to another dir.</p>

<pre><code>BOOL startedProgram = CreateProcess("xulrunner.exe", "application.ini", [fill in other options as you need]);
</code></pre>

<p>Unions are dangerous and risky to use without strict discipline. And the fact you put it in a struct is really dangerous because by default all struct members are public: that exposes the possibility of client code making changes to your union, without informing your program what type of data it stuffed in there. If you use a union you should put it in a class where at least you can hide it by making it private.</p>

<p>We had a dev years ago who drank the koolaid of unions, and put it in all his data structures. As a result, the features he wrote with it, are now one of the most despised parts of our entire application, since they are unmodifiable, unfixable and incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Also Unions throw away all the type safety that modern c/c++ compilers give you. Surely if you lie to the compiler it will get back at you someday. Well actually it will get back at your customer when your app crashes.</p>

<p>Hi geeks~ :)</p>

<p>In my scenario, I want to execute a method in a separate AppDomain. <strong>How many different ways</strong> could I take to achieve this?</p>

<p>Especially, I have the following question:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can I load an assembly into AppDomain A and execute its method in AppDomain B? </li>
<li>It seems I achieve this with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain.docallback.aspx" rel="nofollow">AppDomain.DoCallBack Method</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.crossappdomaindelegate.aspx" rel="nofollow">CrossAppDomainDelegate</a>. I just cannot figure out how could it make sense to have the assembly and the method in different AppDomains. Is the same assmebly loaded again into the other AppDomain in order to execute the method?</li>
</ul>

<p>It appears you installed WWW::Mechanize into a directory that isn't searched by default.  Most likely, you have a PERL5LIB or other environment variable that adds that directory to Perl's search path, and for some reason that's not set in the environment TextMate provides.</p>

<p>Try running <code>perl -V</code> from the shell and from TextMate and see what the difference in search paths is.  You can also add</p>

<pre><code>print "$INC{'WWW/Mechanize.pm'}\n";
</code></pre>

<p>to your test script to find out where it's installed.</p>

<p><code>os.system()</code> is <code>system()</code>, in Win32 <code>getcwd()</code> is <code>GetCurrentDirectory()</code></p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa364934(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa364934(VS.85).aspx</a></p>

<p>Probably should stick to char buffers for strings.  So, something like (untested, untried)</p>

<pre><code> #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

 int main(int ac, char **av) {
    char path[MAX_PATH+1];
    GetCurrentDirectory(MAX_PATH, path);
    char final[MAX_PATH * 2 + 100];
    sprintf(final, "%s /xulrunner.exe %s/application.ini", path, path);
    printf("%s", final);
    system(final);
    // not sure what the notepad call is for, probably another system call
    return 0;
 }

<p>I would recommend Sencha Touch or Sproutcore.  </p>

<p>Sencha Touch is very similar to EXTJS, which a lot of front end developers really like.  Check out</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/</a></p>

<p>It is probably more mature than SC, and you will have a larger developer base on which to draw.  You are gonna wanna try out the demos on that link, on a phone or ipad if you have one.</p>

<p>However, I personally like the strong MVC pattern that Sproutcore enforces.  The mobile framework exists, but I don't know of any major clients adopting it, yet.  The founder of SC, Charles Jolley, recently left Apple to push his framework; its gonna be big.</p>

<p>I've been using the jQuery UI button all over my page, however I haven't found a way around what seems to be a simple problem. I want some of my buttons to be smaller than the other, this should be as simple as setting the CSS of the button text to something like, <code>font: .8em;</code> However jQuery UI takes your DOM element and wraps it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button class="ui-button ui-button-text-only ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all"&gt;
   &lt;span class="ui-button-text"&gt;Button Label&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So if I have a <code>&lt;button class="small-button"&gt;Small button!&lt;/button&gt;</code> jQuery will place the text in a child span. Any font size given to the <code>small-button</code> class will be ignored.</p>

<p>There's got to be a way around this without hacking at how jQuery makes its buttons. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Does PHP have a virtual machine like Java?</p>

<pre><code>char patches2[][64]
</code></pre>

<p>This is an array of arrays.  The first dimension is determined automatically from the number of elements in the initializer.  The second dimension is specified as being 64 <code>char</code>s.</p>

<p>Some of the string literals with which you initialize <code>patches2</code> are longer than 64 characters in length.  You need to increase the size to some value large enough to hold the largest C string in the initializer.</p>

<p>Boost's Filesystem library provides platform-independent directory functions. It will increase your program size a bit, but using Boost is often better (and often easier) than rolling your own.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What sort of frameworks should I be looking at?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try a modern framework like <a href="http://kohanaframework.org/" rel="nofollow">Kohana</a> or maybe something more engineered-OO like <a href="http://framework.zend.com/" rel="nofollow">Zend Framework</a>.  </p>

<p>You also might want to consider a simple <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3023818/any-procedural-php-framework-non-oo">procedural framework</a> instead of an OO framework.  PHP does very, very well working at low levels.</p>

<p>Avoid Cake.  It tries to be Rails-like, but not only do Rails idioms translate very poorly into PHP, Cake is stuck in the design era of PHP4. </p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Independently from the platform PHP is running on, the scripts are compiled into the same bytecode and run by the Zend Engine.</p>

<p>The difference from Java is that this compiled code is usually not stored into separate files and the scripts are re-compiled on each execution (however, see opcode caches).</p>

<p>I'm using feincms in a django project and I want to use manage.py dumpdata but I get nothing:</p>

<p>Well, the declaration for a single string looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>const char* myString = "MyString";
</code></pre>

<p>What you probably want is an array of <code>const char*</code>s. You can change <code>char patches2[][64]</code> to <code>const char* patches2[]</code> (an array of pointers to <code>const char</code>).</p>

<p>The number of <code>const char*</code>s in <code>patches2</code> can be calculated using <code>sizeof()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>const char* patches2[] = {"CreateMutexW", /* The rest... */ };
int numPatches = sizeof(patches2) / sizeof(const char*);
</code></pre>

<p>So if you add/remove some strings, you don't have to update the dimensions.</p>

<p>I had a similar issue, it turned out that I needed to manually update the zf.bat and zf.php files that came included with xampp after updating to the latest zend framework.</p>

<p>I got them from the zend svn here: <a href="http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/bin/" rel="nofollow">http://framework.zend.com/svn/framework/standard/trunk/bin/</a></p>

<p>i am trying to install apache version 2.2.16, on my windows 7 machine. the apache is installed correctly. but when i try to run the service, i get a error message saying, "The requested operation has failed"...
i tried all the methods, i.e disable antivirus, skype, 
but still the same result.
</p>

<p>Can anybody tell me why is this not working?</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;input name ="txtChat" id ="txtChat" onkeydown ="isEnterPressed();"  type="text" style="width:720px;"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is my javascript function :-</p>

<pre><code> function isEnterPressed(event){
                alert(event);

            }
</code></pre>

<p>On alert i always gets undefined :(</p>

<p>Thanks in advance :)</p>

<p>Hello, I think this task should be obvious but I couldn't find how to do it.</p>

<p>I am going to create a Java DB database (Derby) that will later be copied from my computer to another computer through a SQL script. Can I create it using Netbeans' GUI and then export it (and if yes, how), or do I have to write the script myself?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Are you runnin IIS on the same machine? By default, they will try to bind to the same port 80), and if IIS is running on bootup, then Apache will not be able to start. Try disabling IIS on startup, or else change the port that one or the other uses.</p>

<p>Active Directory defaults to returning a max of 1000 results.  What is sort of annoying is that rather than return 1000, with an associated error code, it seems to send the error code without the data.</p>

<p>eDirectory starts with no default, and is completely conifgurable to whatever you like.</p>

<p>Other directories handle it differently.  (Edit and add in, if you know).</p>

<p>Use:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW vw_summary AS
WITH example AS (
    SELECT t.idcase,
           t.startdate,
           t.startime,
           t.isscheduled,
           t.isoncalendar,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY t.idcase ORDER BY t.startdate DESC, 
                                                             t.starttime DESC, 
                                                             t.isscheduled DESC,
                                                             t.isoncalendar DESC) AS rank
      FROM TABLE t)
SELECT e.*
  FROM example e
 WHERE e.rank = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Check &amp; see - might tweak the ORDER BY on the ROW_NUMBER...</p>

<p>I have a program with a function copied below it plays a sound upon clicking a button. If you click the button 10 times 10 different media players play the same sound that is the way i want it but how can i assign a button to stop all 10 media players at a time like a "STOP ALL BUTTON"</p>

<pre><code>public void onClick(View v){
 int resId = 0;
 int stopped = 0;
 switch (v.getId()){
 case R.id.Wail:
  resId = R.raw.fedsigwail;
  break;
 case R.id.Yelp:
  resId = R.raw.fedsigyelp;
  break;
 case R.id.HiLow:
  resId = R.raw.hilow;     
  break;
 case R.id.FederalQ:
  resId = R.raw.federalq;
  break;
 case R.id.Horn:
  resId = R.raw.fedsignhorn;
  break;
 case R.id.STOPALL:
  mp.stop();
  mp.release();
  stopped = 1;
  break;
 }

 if (stopped != 1){
 mp = MediaPlayer.create(this, resId);
 mp.start();
 }


}
</code></pre>

<p>The code above only stops the last instance of mp.</p>

<p>Any Input would be appreciated</p>

<p>what about remapping your keyboard? I for one remap ctrl on all my keyboards to the caps lock key.  Makes it way easier..</p>

<p>If it's styling <code>ui-button-text</code> with <code>font-size</code> directly, you can override it at a higher level by applying !important. Such as:</p>

<pre><code>.small-button {
   font-size: .8em !important;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: try setting a CSS style directly on <code>.ui-button-text</code> to inherit:</p>

<pre><code>.ui-button-text {
   font-size: inherit !important;
} 
</code></pre>

<p>This should also make the !important on the <code>.small-button</code> irrelevant.</p>

<p>There is no built-in event type that is fired when the enter key is pressed, you need to check that in the <code>Event</code> object that is passed to the handler.</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input name ="txtChat" id ="txtChat" onkeyup="onKeyPressed(event)"  type="text" style="width:720px;"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>function onKeyPressed(ev) {
   var e = ev || event;
   if(e.keyCode == 13) {
      //Enter was pressed
      return false; //prevents form from being submitted.
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A very simple inline check is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input name ="txtChat" id ="txtChat" onkeydown ="alert(event.keyCode == 13);"  type="text" style="width:720px;"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which outputs <code>true</code> if enter is pressed.</p>

<p>As always when doing LDAP bind testing this way, recall that the standard requires that a bind of a username, no password, is a successful Anonymous bind, so therefore you MUST validate for this case (empty password) on login attempts.</p>

<p>In order to execute code in a separate AppDomain, the assembly containing that code has to be loaded into that AppDomain. From there you can call a method in the second AppDomain from your hosting domain using reflection or the "CreateInstance" methods on the AppDomain class.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, AppDomains are hard boundaries. In order to communicate across the AppDomain boundaries, you will need to use remoting or a true IPC-ish mechanism.</p>

<p>This is a bit dated, but I believe it still applies. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/suzcook/archive/2003/06/12/57169.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/suzcook/archive/2003/06/12/57169.aspx</a></p>

<p>Suzanne Cook had a series of posts related to this subject so it may be worth browsing her archives a bit.</p>

<p>Check out the "CreateInstance" family of methods on the AppDomain class. In the past I've used <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.appdomain.createinstanceandunwrap.aspx" rel="nofollow">CreateInstanceFromAndUnwrap()</a> quite a bit for this type of situation.</p>

<p>As far as your question about how many ways there are to do this... Um, many, but it depends a lot on the exact situation and what objects you have in hand.</p>

<p>Hey guys, I am trying to figure out how I can call a function without having it being exported.</p>

<p>Okay so I have an exe file with "add" defined in it, This exe is a win32 console application and loads a DLL. The DLL also aims to use the add function from the exe file ( without exports )</p>

<p>Here is my main win32 console application file:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#pragma auto_inline ( off )

int add ( int a, int b )
{
    printf( "Adding some ints\n" );
    return a + b;
}

int main ( )
{
    HMODULE module = NULL;

    if ( (module = LoadLibrary( L"hook.dll" )) == NULL )
    {
        printf( "Could not load library: %ld\n", GetLastError() );
        return 0;
    }

    add( 3, 5 );

    FreeLibrary( module );

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is code for hook.dll:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;detours.h&gt;

static int (*add) ( int a, int b ) = ( int (*)( int a, int b ) ) 0x401000;

int Detoured_add ( int a, int b )
{
    return add( a, b );
}

BOOL WINAPI DllMain ( HINSTANCE hDll, DWORD reason, LPVOID reserved )
{
    if ( reason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH )
    {
        DetourTransactionBegin();
        DetourAttach( (PVOID*) &amp;add, Detoured_add );
        DetourTransactionCommit();

    }
    else if ( reason == DLL_PROCESS_DETACH )
    {
        DetourTransactionBegin();
        DetourDetach( (PVOID*) &amp;add, Detoured_add );
        DetourTransactionCommit();
    }

    return TRUE;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I disassembled my win32 console application to find the address of the add function</p>

<pre><code>.text:00401000 ; ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ S U B R O U T I N E ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦
.text:00401000
.text:00401000
.text:00401000 sub_401000      proc near               ; CODE XREF: sub_401020:loc_40104Bp
.text:00401000                 push    offset aAddingSomeInts ; "Adding some ints\n"
.text:00401005                 call    ds:printf
.text:0040100B                 add     esp, 4
.text:0040100E                 mov     eax, 8
.text:00401013                 retn
.text:00401013 sub_401000      endp
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is when I call LoadLibrary, it returns 998 which I believe is error code access violation. I guess this makes sense though as that memory area is probably protected.</p>

<p>Any tips?</p>

<p>( Also, the disassembler I used is Ida Pro free version, and the detours library is provided by Microsoft. )</p>

<p>It was used during the typewriter era to move down a page to the next vertical stop, typically spaced 6 lines apart (much the same way horizontal tabs move along a line by 8 characters).</p>

<p>In modern day settings, the vt is of very little, if any, significance.</p>

<p>Make an outlet for the button and connect it.</p>

<p>in the .h, between the curly braces</p>

<pre><code> UIButton* button;
</code></pre>

<p>after the curly</p>

<pre><code> @property(retain, nonatomic) IBOutlet UIButton* button;
</code></pre>

<p>and in the .m, after the @implementation</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize button;
</code></pre>

<p>Then connect in IB by dragging a referencing outlet circle in the connections inspector to File's Owner and choosing button.</p>

<p>Now you can change the button text with </p>

<pre><code> [self.button setTitle: @"hello" forState: UIControlStateNormal]; // or any string, like from your table
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty much the same as omg ponies answer. Row_number is your friend. I'm not entirely sure the bit fields are treated as you want, but you get the idea. As ever, it's always best to be explicit with the fields you are selecting, but I'm lazy.</p>

<pre><code>create table #table 
(
    idHearing int,
    idCase int,
    startDate datetime,
    starttime datetime,
    isscheduled bit,
    isoncalendar bit
);
insert into #table values(1,1,'8/2/2010','3:30:00 PM',1,1)
insert into #table values(2,1,'8/2/2010','3:30:00 PM',1,0)
insert into #table values(3,2,'8/3/2010','5:30:00 PM',1,1)
insert into #table values(4,2,'8/4/2010','9:30:00 PM',1,1)
insert into #table values(5,3,'8/2/2010','3:00:00 PM',1,1)

select * from
(
    select 
        row_number() 
            over 
            (partition by idcase order by 
                startdate desc,
                starttime desc,
                isscheduled desc,
                isoncalendar desc
            ) idCasePosition,
        * 
    from #table
) x
where idCasePosition=1

drop table #table

<p>As far as I know , sql server express does not have DBMail feature. </p>

<p>However I have seen this blog and after some configuration I had it working.</p>

<p><a href="http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/07/01/60245.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2007/07/01/60245.aspx</a></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I did get into few issues so I upgraded my version to SQl Server professional. I recommend you do the same. You may hack express and have it working but you will face issues in the future because it is not meant to work with this version.</p>

<p>For the automatic checking with delay, you should use an AsyncTask, like a thread where you can modify things within the Android main UI thread, i.e. like checking the checkboxes.</p>

<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/painless-threading.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/painless-threading.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.xoriant.com/blog/mobile-application-development/android-async-task.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.xoriant.com/blog/mobile-application-development/android-async-task.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html</a></p>

<p>The checkboxes can be part of a listview, but don't have to be. You can also add them into a LinearLayout with vertical orientation one by one.</p>

<p>You can do like this:</p>

<p>You have to pass the button to the UITableViewController and then when you select a row, set the text for the button:</p>

<pre><code>UITableViewController *viewController = [[CustomTableViewController alloc] initWithButton:self.button];
</code></pre>

<p>then in tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath:</p>

<pre><code>[self.button setTitle:cell.textLabel.text forState:UIControlStateNormal];
</code></pre>

<p>Don't forget to save the button in your init with:</p>

<pre><code>-(id)initWithButton:(UIButton *)button {
  // do something
  _button = button
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I'm have horrendous problems trying to get a JOGL program compiling using Netbeans 6.9. I can't seem to find an up to date explanation as to how to do this. When I install the NetBeans OpenGL pack I can't compile the examples. I get a compile error stating it can't find some methods such as GLCanvas(). When I go to the library to see if the GLCanvas class is there I find that it's not!</p>

<p>Can anybody help me out and show me how I can setup JOGL with Netbeans? I'd GREATLY appreciate it!</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>

# (the other subfolder 'build' can be deleted)
# note: with console code put a wait line at the end

from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe
import sys

sys.argv.append("py2exe")
sys.argv.append("-q")

<p>Ok so this is what i did and seems like a nice solution.</p>

<p>on the section page (ie: bathrooms.shtml or mastersuite.shtml) i used this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

var section='1';

&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>the value of "section" is the section that that the page is under.</p>

<p>and then on my navbar script i used this</p>

<pre><code>$(window).load(function() {//functionality
$('#section1').hoverIntent(navSelect('.interior','0px'));
$('#section2').hoverIntent(navSelect('.exterior','100px'));
$('#section3').hoverIntent(navSelect('.view','200px'));

function navSelect(section,selectorPosition){
    var func = function(evt){
        if ( $(section).is(':hidden')){
        $('.subSection').fadeOut(250);
        $(section).delay(250).fadeIn(250);
        $('#selector').animate({"left":selectorPosition},250);
        }
    }
    return { over: func, out: func };

//----------------------------------------------------------
if(section==0){//index page
$(window).load(function() {

<p>I like this because it requires no querystring or anchors, and it is ridiculously simple</p>

<pre><code> UIActionSheet *actionSheet = [[UIActionSheet alloc]
        initWithTitle:nil
        delegate:self
        cancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel"
        destructiveButtonTitle:@"Delete Today's Data"
        otherButtonTitles:@"Delete Week's Data",@"Delete Month's Data",nil];
</code></pre>

<p>Is there an easy to have more than 1 red "destructive button" in an iPhone app's UIActionSheet?</p>

<p>I wanted to make 1 "DELETE" button... and then have the actionSheet ask/confirm between 3-4 different "delete choices" (or just 1 cancel).</p>

<p>(Instead of having 4 different DELETE buttons... and have to maintain 4 different actionSheets... 1 for each)</p>

<p>... also... would Apple have a problem with a submission to the appStore with this idea?</p>

<p>Adding to Rob's correct answer, I want to mention that any attempt to call without using reflection is going to cause the assembly to be loaded into your calling AppDomain, which may well be what you're trying to avoid.</p>

<p><code>mp.stop();</code> only stops one instance of a media player, since mp can only be one mediaplayer instance.
If mp is one of your media players, where are the other ones? You mentioned you have </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>10 different media players</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so I would expect something like mp1, mp2, mp3, ..., mp10. But right now it seems you actually only using one media player instance, or at least stopping it.</p>

<p>With each call of</p>

<pre><code>mp = MediaPlayer.create(this, resId)
</code></pre>

<p>you lose the reference to the previous created media player, since you 'override' it with a newly created instance.
You need to keep a reference to all your created media players, i.e. via an ArrayList or HashMap or similar.</p>

<p>It uses a class that extends <code>AsyncTask</code> which allows you to use threading in a easy to use/understand way. The way this class is executed is kind of simple:</p>

<pre><code>new CheckerAsync(AutoChecker.this).execute(checkbox1, checkbox2);
</code></pre>

<p>You can add as many checkboxes as you want. For instance: </p>

<pre><code>new CheckerAsync(AutoChecker.this).execute(checkbox1, checkbox2, checkbox4, checkbox3);
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, I don't know why you are trying to do this. But, if it's for testing purposes, you better take a look at the <a href="http://www.google.com.co/search?q=instrumentation+framework+android&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.gentoo%3aen-US%3aunofficial&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">instrumentation framework</a>.</p>

<p>I'm new to stackoverflow and cannot yet comment on questions or I would put this in a comment, but I too have this problem regularly and would love to see it answered.</p>

<p>With regard to unique merging I can't help you there, but if your app by any chance happens to be in PHP then you can use php's <a href="http://www.php.net/array_merge" rel="nofollow">array_merge</a> function to merge them before outputting the HTML.</p>

<p><a href="http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/" rel="nofollow">ReplaceWith</a> is a nice jquery function to replace aka "paste" over, it may will help you with half of your solution. </p>

<p>Right now I am trying to use selenium ide to write code that makes sure web pages on a website work. On one particular page there is a table that has text boxes in each cell. You can add a row by clicking a button. What I want to do on this page is type data into the first two rows. I used selenium ide and recorded me typing in data. Then I tried to replay it. It worked fine until it came to the second row. The second row it could not write data to. The first row text boxes had targets of terms[] and defs[] . the second row looks the exact same but has targets of <code>//td[@id='autoDefinerTd']/textarea</code> and <code>//table[@id='termList']/tbody/tr[3]/td[3]/textarea</code> . I am completely stumped on what to do to fix this and why they are different. If someone could help me I would be so grateful.
Thanks in adavnce.</p>

<p>Okay, I know there is another question about "exc_bad_access" here, but that seems to deal with Objective-C and iPhone dev., while mine is only regular C.  I am new to C and am almost done with my first program until this error showed up.  I have been trying to figure it out for a couple of days and am going insane.  Any help is appreciated.

<p>I can input a char to the fgets after the "Edit?" prompt, but then I get the exc_bad_access error.  Please help, thanks.code:</p>

<h2>Use Case:</h2>

<p>Would like to use IReport to Label item sold in my shop. The thing with labels is that for each product there can be multiple items that need to be labeled. So let say product CarToy is 1 record in database (field name, description, price).</p>

<h2>Question:</h2>

<p>To label CarToy item in my shop I will have to print a report containing the 3 field on a sticker paper.</p>

<p>Doing it the normal way will result to a report containing 1 sticker. </p>

<p>If there is 5 item in my shop. Then I would like to print 5 sticker in the report. </p>

<p>Basically I would like to pass a query result containing records (row of data) to IReport and tell it how many time to print/display each record/row. Assuming that I can pass the required parameter (for instance repeat X time) from my program.</p>

<p>Any idea how this can be done?</p>

<h2>Unwanted Solution</h2>

<p>Possibly this can be solve at software data layer. For instance I can pass a result set that contains each row already duplicated/repeat X times. Example: Query the CarToy (which result to 1 record). Manually create a result set containing 5 CarToy records and pass this to Jasper Report.</p>

<p>However I would like to give a solution to end user in a form of JasperReport report xml that can be customized on their side. So above is not a solution that I'm looking for.</p>

<p>Better yet if I can do everything using IReport withou any requirement to modify software. For this to be done perhaps there is some scripting ability or I can create a simple GUI in IReport that accept the (repeat X time) parameter.</p>

<p>Ryan, there is a php framework called <a href="http://www.elgg.org" rel="nofollow">Elgg</a> which is a php framework directed at social networking based applications.</p>

<p>I have my own, very fast cos function:</p>

<pre><code>float sine(float x)
{
    const float B = 4/pi;
    const float C = -4/(pi*pi);

    float y = B * x + C * x * abs(x);

    //  const float Q = 0.775;
    const float P = 0.225;

    y = P * (y * abs(y) - y) + y;   // Q * y + P * y * abs(y)


    return y;
}

float cosine(float x)
{
    return sine(x + (pi / 2));
}
</code></pre>

<p>But now when I profile, I see that acos() is killing the processor. I don't need instense precision. What is a fast way to calculate acos(x)

<p>Hi,
If I were to use separate Windows Server that was PCI-DSS compliant, would I still be compliant if I had a SQL Azure hosting the backend? This is assuming that I'm compliant at the application layer, and that I'm only storing permitted values (like no CVV), etc.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Jack</p>

<p>I would  highly recommend looking into Mindscape's LIGHTSPEED. Excellent platform and built on really good disign principals, really cuts down on development time once you get a hang of the basics. Also do a feature comparison to nhibernate, entity framework etc.</p>

<p>I've just been browsing and spotted the following...</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/54585/when-should-you-use-a-class-vs-a-struct-in-c">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/54585/when-should-you-use-a-class-vs-a-struct-in-c</a></p>

<p>The consensus there is that, by convention, you should only use struct for POD, no methods, etc.</p>

<p>I've always felt that some types were naturally structs rather than classes, yet could still have a few helper functions as members. The struct should still be POD by most of the usual rules - in particular it must be safe to copy using memcpy. It <em>must</em> have all member data public. But it still makes sense to me to have helper functions as members. I wouldn't even necessarily object to a private method, though I don't recall ever doing this myself. And although it breaks the normal POD rules, I wouldn't object to a struct having constructors, provided they were just initialise-a-few-fields constructors (overriding assignment or destructors would definitely be against the rules).</p>

<p>To me a struct is intuitively a collection of fields - a data structure node or whatever - whereas a class is an abstraction. The logical place to put the helper functions for your collection-of-fields may well be within the struct.</p>

<p>I even <em>think</em> I once read some advice along these lines, though I don't remember where.</p>

<p>Is this against accepted best practice?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> - POD (Plain Old Data) is misrepresented by this question. In particular, a struct can be non-POD purely because a member is non-POD - e.g. an aggregate with a member of type std::string. That aggregate must not be copied with memcpy. In case of confusion, see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/146452/what-are-pod-types-in-c">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have a simple online product that I'm selling. I need a credit card order form. </p>

<p>I'm looking for a sample php based order form. A form that collects name, address, credit card, exp date, and cvv and validates that the fields (for example checks that the credit card number is in the correct format). Forget the payment gateway integration I just need the the form and validation. </p>

<p>Does anyone know of such a resource? </p>

<p>Another way that verges on "cute" would be to have a static object and call your function from within its constructor.  Something like...</p>

<pre><code>   struct OneShotOtherRoutine
   {
      OneShotOtherRoutine(A a, Params params)
      {
         a.OtherRoutine(params);
      }
   };

   struct A
   {
      friend struct OneShotOtherRoutine;
      public:
         void MainRoutine(Params params)
         {
              static OneShotOtherRoutine(params);
              // Main Routine code
         }
      private:
         void OtherRoutine(Params params)
         {
           // Other routine code
         }
  };
</code></pre>

<p>You'd have to split things up so that each implementation could see the other struct's declaration, but this could do what you want, assuming it's acceptable that <code>OtherRoutine</code> gets called when statics are initialized.</p>

<p>It happens because your pointers point to no memory.</p>

<pre><code>char* z; // pointer points nowhere
/* snip */
fgets(z, 2, stdin); // writing to pointer that points nowhere: boom!
</code></pre>

<p>This tries to put into <code>z</code> the two next characters from <code>stdin</code>. However, <code>z</code> points to nowhere useful. You need it to point to existing memory: declaring a pointer alone isn't enough to get memory next to it.</p>

<p>You probably want a buffer of 2 characters for it:</p>

<pre><code>char z[2];
</code></pre>

<p>With this code, <code>z</code> will be a pointer to enough memory for 2 characters. (In C, an array can be passed wherever a pointer is expected.)</p>

<p>I didn't look too far into your code, but you'll have the same problem for <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>For anybody else that has this issue, a good application I just found is the sample app included with the source. For anybody answering, I didn't think about checking the source for samples when I posted this. The name of the sample is called FunnyBrowser.cs.</p>

<p>You haven't allocated any memory for <code>z</code> or <code>y</code> <strong>and</strong> they're left uninitialized so <code>fgets</code> is writing to random addresses.</p>

<p>Got spare memory? A lookup table (with interpolation, if required) is gonna be fastest.</p>

<p>Using nested <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s you can create a dashed border with alternating colors:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span style="border-bottom: 3px solid #ff0"&gt;
  &lt;span style="border-bottom: 3px dashed #f00"&gt;
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It would be a bit harder to do with dots, though.</p>

<p>If you're using the GPS_Provider, make sure that you have the following permission in your app manifest:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But usually GPS only works with a free sky (not indoors very well). Therefore while Google Maps might show the last known location, maybe your app doesn't. So you might want to initially call <code>getLastKnowLocation</code> initially to set the initial marker. 
Even though GPS cannot get a fix, you could still show the last known location known to the device, i.e. when you were outdoors last time.</p>

<p>Alternatively or additionally to GPS_Provider, you could also use the</p>

<pre><code>LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER
</code></pre>

<p>instead,which is based on Wifi and/or GMS, is less accurate than GPS but works indoors.</p>

<p>For this, you need the permission</p>

<pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>in your manifest.</p>

<p>I've got a project in a git repository that uses some custom (and so far unversioned) setup scripts for the build environment etc. I'd like to put these under version control (hopefully git) but keep them versioned separate from the project itself, while still living in the base directory of the project - I've considered options like local branches but these seem to have the problem that switch back to <code>master</code> (or any other "real" branch) will throw away the working copies of the setup scripts.</p>

<p>I'm on Windows using msysgit so I've got a few tools to play with; does anyone have a recommendation or solution?</p>

<p>It is, in fact, possible. Here's how I did it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="checkout-flow-support.merchant-checkout-flow-support.shipping-methods.flat-rate-shipping-1.name" value="Delivery"/&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="checkout-flow-support.merchant-checkout-flow-support.shipping-methods.flat-rate-shipping-1.price" value="123.45"/&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="checkout-flow-support.merchant-checkout-flow-support.shipping-methods.flat-rate-shipping-1.price.currency" value="USD"/&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="checkout-flow-support.merchant-checkout-flow-support.shipping-methods.flat-rate-shipping-1.shipping-restrictions.allow-us-po-box" value="false"/&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="checkout-flow-support.merchant-checkout-flow-support.shipping-methods.flat-rate-shipping-1.shipping-restrictions.allowed-areas.us-country-area-1.country-area" value="CONTINENTAL_48"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Tricky for sure, but it works.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HTML offers authors several mechanisms for specifying lists of information. All lists must 
  contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain: unordered information, ordered 
  information and definitions. (from <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/lists.html#edef-UL" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/lists.html#edef-UL</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think lists are the most important elements in HTML: semantically, there are so many objects that are pure lists. It is also a good practice to use <code>ul</code> or <code>dl</code> to group input fields and labels in <code>form</code> too. </p>

<p>Someone will markup form using paragraphs:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="" method="post"&gt;
    &lt;fieldset&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;
                Full Name: 
                &lt;input type="text" name="name" /&gt;
            &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;
                Password: 
                &lt;input type="password" name="password" /&gt;
            &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
    &lt;fieldset&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;
                Occupation: 
                &lt;input type="text" name="occupation" /&gt;
            &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;
                Location: 
                &lt;input type="text" name="location" /&gt;
            &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

            &lt;!-- &lt;dd class="error"&gt;Some errors/validation warnings&lt;/dd&gt; --&gt;

            &lt;dt&gt;&lt;label for="password"&gt;Password:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
            &lt;dd&gt;&lt;input id="password" type="password" name="password" /&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
            &lt;!-- &lt;dd class="note"&gt;Some notes about the field above&lt;/dd&gt; --&gt;
        &lt;/dl&gt;

<p>Forms <em>are</em> lists (lists of fields, grouped data), because they have uniform and repetitive structure:</p>

<pre><code>INPUT_1
INPUT_2
...
INPUT_N
</code></pre>

<p>Reading Remou's comment, I inserted an extra column at the beginning in the excel worksheet and numbered it in series from 1.</p>

<p>Importing into access after this didn't cause any reordering of rows.</p>

<p>After an animation involving the opacity, you will want to clear the opacity value (back to a default of no value) to fix this mangled antialiasing in IE. Try this jQuery on the section in question after the animation is complete (e.g. in a callback):</p>

<pre><code>$('.item').css('filter','');
</code></pre>

<p>If anyone read my last question, this is somewhat of a continuation of it.</p>

<p>AFAIK, when using jQuery UI's Autocomplete ability to grab data from an XML file as its data source, you can only do it from one file in the Ajax call.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.finalfantasyunion.com/includes/xml/games.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.finalfantasyunion.com/includes/xml/games.xml</a></p>

<p>I'm planning to have a series of XML files like that with different data but the same items -> item tag format.</p>

<p>I could have a MySQL database which I query data from (where the file is really an PHP file but reports itself as a XML file once I've gotten the data) dynamically create an XML file, but if possible I'd rather not have this require a database connection if at all possible --- that way other staff members could edit the file easily as new games are announced/etc.</p>

<p>EDIT: The reason I don't want everything in one file is because I plan to use autocomplete elsewhere in the backend, and I'll only need specific data for some sections.</p>

<p>Before py2.6 it's been answered here. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/332255/difference-between-class-foo-and-class-fooobject-in-python">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/332255/difference-between-class-foo-and-class-fooobject-in-python</a></p>

<p>But for python2.6+ and python3.x, is the first one wrong?</p>

<p><code>class Foo(): pass</code> vs <code>class Foo(object): pass</code></p>

<p>It depends on whether MyMethod actually changes the string that's passed in.</p>

<p>If the only thing you know about it is the signature, then you have to assume it could change the string, and copy it into a temporary buffer per @jdmichal's answer.</p>

<p>It's also possible that the developer of this API didn't know or care about <code>const</code> correctness.  So the function takes in a non-<code>const</code> buffer even though it doesn't change it.</p>

<p>If that's the case you can get by with:</p>

<pre><code>MyMethod(const_cast&lt;char*&gt;(myStringParameter.c_str());
</code></pre>

<p>In my career I have come across more than a few API's taking in non-<code>const</code> strings that should have been <code>const</code>.</p>

<p>Let's say I have a piece of code that runs fine on an OS. Now, if I install that OS on a virtual machine (server virtualization), and run that code on that, is it possible that the code behaves differently?  </p>

<p>If so, what are the prerequisites for that? For example, does it have to be compiled machine code (in other words, are interpreted languages safe?)? Does it have to be certain OS instructions? Specific virtualization technology (Xen, KVM, VMware..)?    </p>

<p>Also, what are the possible different behaviors? </p>

<p>you can use PSExec like SPE109 says, just be sure to set the -accepteula when calling it or it will just hang</p>

<p>Quick google search brought me to this site: <a href="http://articles.sitepoint.com/print/card-validation-class-php" rel="nofollow">http://articles.sitepoint.com/print/card-validation-class-php</a></p>

<p>Note: The article was written in 2002. So it's definitely a good starting point, but watch out for things that might have changed in php / credit cards in the past 8 years.</p>

<p>It looks like it has pretty good information about validating credit card numbers across different vendors (visa, mc, amex, etc.)</p>

<p>As for the rest of the fields, there are tons of quick validation scripts out there. </p>

<p>I know that <code>.index()</code> will return where a substring is located in python. 
However, what I want is to find where a substring is located for the nth time, which would work like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; s = 'abcdefacbdea'
&gt;&gt; s.index('a')
0
&gt;&gt; s.nindex('a', 1)
6
&gt;&gt;s.nindex('a', 2)
11
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to do this in python?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the Android JavaDocs, it
  is only possible to have one
  MapActivity per class</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not one map view per class, it's per process.</p>

<p>It's known that you might experience some issues when using multiple mapviews in one process. Usually this is the case (your app running in one process) if you don't configure anything specific.
You could though use the android:process attribute in your manifest to assign to your acitivites:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;activity android:name=".activity.directory.MapView1" android:process=":MapView1"&gt;

&lt;activity android:name=".activity.directory.MapView2" android:process=":MapView2"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This way you have the activities running in separate processes, which works well if you don't use any shared static variables across activities.</p>

<p>Also see the discussion on the bug in the android bug tracker:</p>

<p>I have been using Wincent Colaiuta's <a href="https://wincent.com/products/command-t/" rel="nofollow">Command-T vim plugin</a> for a couple months now. Wincent wrote the parts of it that need to be fast in C, and I must say that it is! And, I think its file pattern matching logic is even better than Textmate's Command-T.

<p><a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Easier_buffer_switching" rel="nofollow">Easier buffer switching</a> contains many useful tips. I have adapted the following to my .vimrc, which does buffer-name auto-completion, maps the most useful buffer-switching commands to my &lt;Leader&gt; and left-side home row keys, and shows the current buffer number in the status line:</p>

<pre><code>"" Tab triggers buffer-name auto-completion
set wildchar=&lt;Tab&gt; wildmenu wildmode=full

let mapleader = ","

map &lt;Leader&gt;t :CommandT&lt;Return&gt;
map &lt;Leader&gt;a :bprev&lt;Return&gt;
map &lt;Leader&gt;s :bnext&lt;Return&gt;
map &lt;Leader&gt;d :bd&lt;Return&gt;
map &lt;Leader&gt;f :b 

"" Show the buffer number in the status line.
set laststatus=2 statusline=%02n:%&lt;%f\ %h%m%r%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
</code></pre>

<p>I also use <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=159" rel="nofollow">MiniBufExplorer</a>, which provides a compact listing of each listed buffer in its own horizontal split up top.</p>

<p>It really depends what you mean by "not intense precision"...</p>

<p>You could do it extremely roughly:</p>

<pre><code>float arccos(float x)
{
    return pi * (-x) / 2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a straight-line function</p>

<p>This is very similar to arcsin:</p>

<pre><code>float arcsin(float x)
{
    return -pi * x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, arc-cosine is just arc-sin flipped and shifted up by <code>π/2</code>.</p>

<p>So you could also write your arccos function as:</p>

<pre><code>float arccos(float x) {
    return(pi * 1.5 - arcsin(x));
}
</code></pre>

<p>As far as the language is concerned, it doesn't matter, except for default <code>private</code> vs. <code>public</code> access.  The choice is subjective.</p>

<p>I'd personally say use <code>struct</code> for PODs, but remember that "POD" doesn't mean "no member functions".  It means no <em>virtual</em> functions, constructors, destructor, or <code>operator=</code>.</p>

<p>Edit: I also use <code>struct</code>s for simple <code>public</code>-access aggregates of data, even if their members aren't PODs.</p>

<p>Reconstructing the signature created by Facebook is rather simple. You just need to append all <code>key=value</code> pairs, then append your private key, and finally compute the MD5 hash of the resulting string.</p>

<p>More details on how the signature is constructed can be found on this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3324444/is-auth-token-and-sig-the-same-thing-in-facebook-api/3324546#3324546">answer</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook has provided a PHP example of how to do reconstruct the sig <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web#login" rel="nofollow">here</a> in the Single Sign-On section.</p>

<p>I have written a <a href="http://vombat.tumblr.com/post/835536630/ruby-version-of-facebooks-get-facebook-cookie-in-php" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> doing exactly the same, but in Ruby instead.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, all the standard STL functors are defined as structs, and their <em>sole purpose</em> is to have member functions; STL functors aren't supposed to have state.</p>

<p>EDIT: Personally, I use <code>struct</code> whenever a class has all public members. It matters little, so long as one is consistent.</p>

<p>Without the details of the error you are seeing it is hard to be sure but I'm quite sure that your map is failing because all the parameters within the BizTalk XSLT engine are passed as strings<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>When I try to run something like the function you provided as inline C# I get the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Object of type 'System.String' cannot be converted to type 'System.DateTime'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Replace your inline C# with something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>public string ConvertDateTime(string param1)
{
    DateTime inputDate = DateTime.Parse(param1);
    return inputDate.ToString("yyyyMMdd");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the parameter type is now string, and you can then convert that to a DateTime and perform your string format.</p>

<p>As other answers have suggested, it may be better to put this helper method into an external class - that way you can get your code under test to deal with edge cases, and you also get some reuse.</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> The fact that all parameters in the BizTalk XSLT are strings can be the source of a lot of gotchas - one other common one is with math calculations. If you return numeric values from your scripting functoids BizTalk will helpfully convert them to strings to map them to the outbound schema but will not so helpfully perform some very random rounding on the resulting values. Converting the return values to strings yourself within the C# will remove this risk and give you the expected results.</p>

<p>How can i set images or html links in gmail signature ? any clues on this</p>

<p>Your window class publishes two events for this purpose:</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.closing.aspx" rel="nofollow">Closing</a> allows you to cancel the close if it's inappropriate</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.closed.aspx" rel="nofollow">Closed</a> allows you to react on close.</p>

<p>VVS's answer is correct, with the exception of parsing a path given by a file input in internet explorer (tested with IE8 - I do not know about other versions).  In this case, the path given by the input element's value (input.value) is in the form "C:\fakepath\&lt;filename&gt;".  Note the backslashes here.</p>

<p>The "CVV" (probably the CVV2, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_security_code" rel="nofollow">CSC</a> in general) appears to be the output of a hash function that's stored by the bank, and I suspect that you'd actually have to attempt a transaction to validate it. So I suspect that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3380634/i-need-a-sample-php-credit-card-order-form/3380653#3380653">hookedonwinter's answer</a> is pretty much all you're going to be able to do without actually making a transaction. (Now there's an interesting scam - "we need to conduct an account validation to check your details, this will cost you $0.10, OK?")</p>

<p>Say I have a table animals that has a column parent_id
Say also that I have a type_id on the table to indicate species</p>

<p>So in my Animal class, Animall.all would return all animals.</p>

<p>Say that now I add two new animal types, dog and cat in the animal_types table.  So now some animals have type_id of 1 and some 2.</p>

<p>I could write a named_scope on Animal to return all cats or all dogs.</p>

<p>But what if I wanted to go the route of creating cat and dog classes that reference the animals table, so in dog class, dog.all should issue a query, select * from animals where type_id = 1</p>

<p>Then say I create a class called person, and added a has_many :dogs relationship</p>

<p>How can I make this work?</p>

<p>I changed config file of the windows many times. Before changing config file I stopped the service and after changing config file, started again. Every thing worked fine. </p>

<p>But last time when I made some changes in config file of the windows service and started it - It didnt worked, I even tried reinstalling the service but in vain.</p>

<p>As a last resort I rebuild the service with new config file and copied newly build files on the server and installed the service. To my surprise the Windows service worked perfectly this time.But I have only made changes to config file and the code of the windows service was untouched. My question is, do we need to rebuild the Window service if we change the config file many time?</p>

<p>Make Array is "Static"</p>

<p>Use a broadcast/broadcast receiver</p>

<p>I would suggest that your question needs to be clarified.  Currently, everyone is guessing what about what you are actually asking.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are the arrays intended to represent sets, or lists, or something in between?  In other words, does element order matter, and can there be duplicates?</li>
<li>What does "equal" mean?  Does <code>new Cat()</code> "equal" <code>new Cat()</code>?  Your example suggests that it does!!</li>
<li>What do you mean by the "difference"?  Do you mean set difference?</li>
<li>What do you want to happen if the two arrays have the same length?</li>
<li>Is this a once-off comparison or does it occur repeatedly for the same arrays?</li>
<li>How many elements are there in the arrays (on average)?</li>
<li>Why are you using arrays at all?</li>
</ul>

<p>Making the assumption that these arrays are intended to be true sets, then you probably should be using <code>HashSet</code> instead of arrays, and using collection operations like <code>addAll</code> and <code>retainAll</code> to calculate the set difference.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the arrays are meant to represent lists, it is not at all clear what "difference" means.</p>

<p>If it is critical that the code runs fast, then you most certainly need to rethink your data structures.  If you always start with arrays, you are not going to be able to calculate the "differences" fast ... at least in the general case.</p>

<p>Finally, if you are going to use anything that depends on the <code>equals(Object)</code> method (and that includes any of the Java collection types, you really need to have a clear understanding of what "equals" is supposed to mean in your application.  Are all <code>Cat</code> instances equal?  Are they all different?  Are some <code>Cat</code> instances equal and others not?  If you don't figure this out, and implement the <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code> methods accordingly you will get confusing results.</p>

<p>If you're referring to the automatically generated .config file, then no, the service need not be rebuilt. My guess is that in your last iteration you forgot an end tag or something, which caused the service to fail to load it's configuration.</p>

<p>Your variable needs a name:</p>

<pre><code>static std::vector&lt;int&gt; my_static_vector(3);
</code></pre>

<p>You forgot to give the vector a name, so without any variable pointing to it it's destroyed immediately after it's created</p>

<p>Because <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;(3)</code> creates an unnamed temporary, which lives only to the end of it's contained expression. The debugger can't show destruction in the same line as construction though, so it shows it on the next line.</p>

<p>Give the item an name and normal <code>static</code> semantics will apply.</p>

<p>I need some help understanding the correct way to mix variables with strings like this. I have tried every configuration I can think of and I keep getting an error.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
include('connect.php');
foreach($_GET['item'] as $key=&gt;$value) {

<p>The two events that you should use are <code>FormClosing</code> and <code>FormClosed</code>.</p>

<p>In the .Net Framework verion 2.0 these events replaced the obsolete <code>Closing</code> and <code>Closed</code> events.</p>

<p>The reason for the new events was that the old ones were not raised when the <code>Application.Exit</code> method was called.</p>

<p>An example of the usage of the <code>FormClosing</code> event is below:</p>

<pre><code>public Form1()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    this.FormClosing += Form1_FormClosing;
}

private void Form1_FormClosing(object sender, FormClosingEventArgs e)
{
    DialogResult result = MessageBox.Show("Really close this form?", string.Empty, MessageBoxButtons.YesNo);

    if (result == DialogResult.No)
    {
        e.Cancel = true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That code simply asks the user if they want to close the form, and if No is selected, it then cancels the event. You can put any logic you require in the event handler.</p>

<hr>

<p>The MSDN article on <code>Form.Closing</code> is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.form.closing.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a> and includes references about why the event was made obsolete.

<p>You said, "To me a struct is intuitively a collection of fields - a data structure node or whatever".  What you are describing is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Data_Structures" rel="nofollow">Plain Old Data</a>.  The C++ standard does have an opinion of what POD means with respect to C++ language features.  I suggest that, where possible, you adopt the meaning of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x#Modification_to_the_definition_of_plain_old_data" rel="nofollow">POD used in C++0x</a>.</p>

<p>I need to find a reference for this, but I thought that, as far as type definitions are concerned, the keywords "struct" and "class" are to be synonyms in C++0x.  The only difference being that class defaults to private members, while a struct defaults to public.  This means that you'll never see complier error messages like "Type X first seen using struct, now seen using class." once we're all using C++0x.</p>

<p>I think that it is wrong to have strict rules on when to use class and when to use struct.  If consistency is important to you, the go ahead and make a coding standard that has what ever sort of rules you like.  Just make sure everyone knows that your coding standard relates to how you want you code to look - it doesn't relate to the underlying language features at all.</p>

<p>Maybe to give an example where I break all your rules, you say "To me a struct is intuitively a collection of fields - a data structure node or whatever - whereas a class is an abstraction."  When I want to write a class that implements some abstraction, I define the interface as a struct with pure virtual methods (egad!) - this is exposed in a header, as too is a factory method to construct my concrete class.  The concrete class is not exposed i a public header at all.  Since the concrete class is a secret, it can be implemented however I like and it makes no difference to external code.</p>

<p>I'd suggest that if you think that the keywords struct and class have any relation to the concept of POD, then you're not understanding C++ yet.</p>

<p>With PCI DSS it is important to remember that it is not just about storing, it's "store, process, or transmit." If any of this happens in or through the cloud then the cloud becomes part of your cardholder data environment, thus in scope for PCI compliance. Since it's a cloud that you don't control, there would be no way to verify compliance.</p>

<p>No verification, no compliance. Sorry.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_selenese_commands.html" rel="nofollow">Selenium Commands</a> page would be a good place to start to learn about what all the various commands do and how to use them.</p>

<p>How does the XAML engine search for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.binding.elementname.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Binding.ElementName</code></a> vs <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.relativesource.ancestortype.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>RelativeSource.AncestorType</code></a>.</p>

<p>It would take a huge different when I am searching for a parent Window or Page (that x:Name was set in it), if the ElementName searches up (meaning starting from near current element up the tree levels children, then it's better to use the AncestorType since it won't search the siblings, just the ancestors.
But if it (the ElementName) starts from to top of the visual tree and goes deeper and deeper, then of course I should get it by the ElementName property.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: my question is whether the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.data.binding.elementname.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Binding.ElementName</code></a> is search for the name from the top of the tree, or from the point of the binding upwards.</p>

<p>So please share me with your knowledge.</p>

<pre><code>mysql_query('UPDATE userprojectlist SET category_display_order = ' . $key . ' WHERE category_id = ' . $value );
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>mysql_query("UPDATE userprojectlist SET category_display_order = $key WHERE category_id = $value" );
</code></pre>

<p>This is assuming both variables are integers.</p>

<p>Yes. Like any machine, the virtual machine is just another computer (implemented in software instead of hardware).</p>

<p>For one, lots of commercial apps will blow up when you run them on a VM due to:</p>

<ol>
<li>copy protection detecting the VM</li>
<li>copy protection rigging your hardware, using undocumented features of BIOS/Kernel/hardware</li>
</ol>

<p>Secondly, a VM is just another computer consisting of hardware implemented in assembly instead of circuits/dye/microcode/magic. This means the VM must provide the emulated hardware either through pass-through or emulation. The fact that hardware is very diverse can cause all kinds of different behavior. Also note the possible lack of drivers for or acceleration of the emulated hardware.</p>

<p>But of course a typical business application for example isn't nearly as likely to rely on any hardware details as all it does is call some GUI API.</p>

<p>Interpreted languages are only safe from this to the extent that they are "interpreted", if the interpreted language calls out to some native code, all this is possible again.</p>

<p>For an example of something detecting that it's running under a VM, check <a href="http://invisiblethings.org/papers/redpill.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, it's just one of the literally thousands of ways to detect the VM.</p>

<p>I had foolishly added a firefox configuration (about:config) entry to network.negotiate-auth.delegation.uris. Returning this value to the blank default got everything working smoothly.</p>

<p>The results from SQL Profiler can by tricky to interpret.</p>

<p>The time shown for a command includes the time for the record set to be delivered to the client.  To see this, create a SELECT statement that returns at least a million rows.  Run these tests is SQL Management Studio and run SQL Profiler to trace the results.</p>

<p>First run, send the SQL results to a temporary table (should take a second or so).  Second run, send the the SQL results to the Results window (should take a few seconds).  Note the run time shown in SSMS.  Then note the time reported by SQL Profiler.</p>

<p>You should see that the the time SSMS takes to read the record set, format the results, and display them to Result window increases the duration that is reported for the query.</p>

<p>After all that, I'm saying that when you are running the query from your application, at that level of precision (60 ms), you cannot tell where the slow down is coming from: database, network, or application, just from the reported duration.</p>

<p>You should create a test script and run the query in SSMS and see if the query time degrades when your application is not part of the loop.</p>

<p>SQL Profiler 2008 records duration in microseconds, but only displays it in milliseconds; so rounding is an issue.  Save the trace as a Trace Table and look at results in the Duration column to see the microseconds.  If the problem is within SQL Server, you may see the duration increasing over time.</p>

<p>You can also have the Profiler return the execution plan.  You can look at the execution plan before and after the duration increases and see if the execution plan is changing.</p>

<p>The lines:</p>

<pre><code>sys.argv.append("py2exe")
sys.argv.append("-q")
</code></pre>

<p>seem "unusual" and likely to be causing that "invalid command" message. I'd be curious to know the rationale for having them.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>A common convention is to name the script <code>setup.py</code> (although in this case it's named <code>p2e_simple_con.py</code> it seems). The <code>setup</code> function in it parses the command line, and usually you expect to run it with a command such as:</p>

<pre><code>python setup.py py2exe
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>py2exe</code> is a command that the py2exe package understands and then builds the EXE file. So as long as the py2exe package is installed, that command should be accepted.</p>

<p>The line <code>sys.argv.append("py2exe")</code> adds that command to the command-line, so in your case you should just be able to type:</p>

<pre><code>python p2e_simple_con.py
</code></pre>

<p>to build the exe. However, if you haven't installed the py2exe package, then the base <code>distutils</code> wouldn't recognise the <code>py2exe</code> command. But in that case, I'd expect you to get an exception for the line <code>import py2exe</code>. So, I'm not sure what's going on.</p>

<p>What is the command you used to run the setup program?</p>

<p>Is <code>item</code> an array in the url like <code>item[]</code>? If it's not that's the reason you get that error, you cannot iterate through a non-iterator object!</p>

<p>Also get rid of the single quotes around the values if they are numeric and use string concatenation,</p>

<pre><code>"UPDATE userprojectlist SET category_display_order = " . $key . " WHERE category_id = " . $value . ";"
</code></pre>

<p>In theory the program should run exactly the same as on a physical machine.</p>

<p>In practice however, there may be differences due to </p>

<ul>
<li>Machine\OS configuration and drivers</li>
<li>Load of the virtual machine host.</li>
</ul>

<p>Differences in machine configuration are similar to difference you would see between any difference physical machine.   Depending on how critical you application is to the end user, you should run the same set of tests that you would a physical box to determine whether the environment is acceptable for use.</p>

<p>Depending on the virtualisation technology, the host may not have the ability to guarantee the client resources at specific times.  This can lead to weird behavior on the client.  Potentially you would see more occurrences of application errors due to IO timeouts an starvation of memory.</p>

<p>To successfully virtualise an application for production use you need to do a bit of work to understand the resource profile of the application\client and virtual host.</p>

<p>You can stick your form in paragraphs, tables, lists, definition lists, or a complicated series of spans and divs, but in the end the only things that matter are whether your form works correctly and people can use it.</p>

<p>Spend your time on <a href="http://htmldog.com/guides/htmladvanced/forms/" rel="nofollow"><code>tabindex</code> and usability</a> rather than worrying about the "semantically correct way to write HTML" as defined by a W3C working group or someone's blog.</p>

<p>I think you should read the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Documents/Documents.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000006i" rel="nofollow">Document-Based Applications Overview</a>.</p>

<p>As you might understand, this document is quite a vital read.</p>

<pre><code>Notice: Undefined index: item in updatedb.php on line 3
</code></pre>

<p>This error is saying that there's no such variable as <code>$_GET['item']</code> defined. You probably did not pass <code>$_GET['item']</code> to this page.</p>

<pre><code>Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in pdatedb.php on line 3
</code></pre>

<p>Thus because of the previous error, you get this, as <code>$_GET['item']</code> is not an array.</p>

<p>The errors has nothing to do with the SQL code.</p>

<p>Take a look at my code sample to understand how to use both providers <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3145089/what-is-the-simplest-and-most-robust-way-to-get-the-users-current-location-in-an/3145655#3145655">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3145089/what-is-the-simplest-and-most-robust-way-to-get-the-users-current-location-in-an/3145655#3145655</a></p>

<p>After Lasse discovered that the FindAll method was generating the wrong IL, I then came across another method that was also generating the wrong IL -- I also found the root cause and resolution.</p>

<p>The relevant line in the second method is:</p>

<pre><code>var policy = Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy(dependentKeys, true);
</code></pre>

<p>Cache is my own object. The GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy method returns a System.Runtime.Caching.CacheItemPolicy object. The generated IL, however, looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>Func&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt; policy = (Func&lt;Feature, FeatureModel&gt;) base.Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy(dependentKeys, true);
</code></pre>

<p>There are two projects in play here. The methods that are generating the wrong IL are in one project called DomainModel, and the Cache object is in a Utilities project, which is referenced by the first. The second project contains a reference to System.Runtime.Caching but the first does not.</p>

<p>The fix was to add a reference to System.Runtime.Caching to the first project. Now the generated IL looks correct:</p>

<pre><code>CacheItemPolicy policy = base.Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy(dependentKeys, true);
</code></pre>

<p>The first method (that Lasse posted about in his answer) now also generates proper IL.</p>

<p>Hooray!</p>

<p>Johannes has mentioned the main issues with your current approach.</p>

<p>It is possible to do form alpha blending in Windows Forms but you will need to use the Windows API call (among others): <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633556%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">UpdateLayeredWindow</a>.</p>

<p>Visual C# kicks has a <a href="http://www.vcskicks.com/splash-screen.php" rel="nofollow">helpful tutorial and source code</a> on how to do this to create a professional looking splash screen.</p>

<p>The only drawback is that if your form contains child controls such as buttons, textboxes, they will not be drawn using UpdateLayeredWindow.  However you could still simulate buttons etc by manually drawing them as part of the form background.</p>

<p>It's just a table definition with three tds per tr, specifying the command and any other parameters needed.</p>

<p>Example from <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/02_selenium_basics.html#script-syntax" rel="nofollow">the docs</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;open&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;/download/&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

<p>The IDE also has a reference built into it. I suggest you peruse the documentation available on their site until you are comfortable with the way the IDE works -- it can be a little unintuitive if you haven't done so.</p>

<p>The way in rails to do this is STI (single Table inheritance).  Short answer is your add a type field to the table, and then subclass animal. </p>

<p>see <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html" rel="nofollow">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html</a></p>

<p>so in your case you would have. </p>

<pre><code>class Animal &lt; ActiveRecord::Base; end
class Dog &lt; Animal; end
class Cat &lt; Animal; end 
</code></pre>

<p>I would probably use</p>

<pre><code>[index for index, value in enumerate(s) if s == 'a'][n]
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import islice
next(islice((index for index, value in enumerate(s) if s == 'a'), n, None))
</code></pre>

<p>or avoid dealing in indices at all.</p>

<p>EditText is not available on widgets. That's why there's no EditText on the search widget. It just looks like EditText. When you click over the search widget it starts another activity with EditText.</p>

<pre><code>def nindex(str, substr, index):
  slice = str
  n = 0
  while index:
    n += slice.index(substr) + len(substr)
    slice = str[n:]
    index -= 1
  return slice.index(substr) + n
</code></pre>

<p>I use my local ip for that i.e. 192.168.0.1 and it works.</p>

<p>How can I pass a generic type to a method, when I don't know the type?</p>

<pre><code>public static class ExecContext&lt;E&gt; {

    public void doSomething(E e) {

        System.out.println(e);
    }
}

public static void exec(ExecContext&lt;?&gt; ctx) {

    String s = new String("saoj");

    ctx.doSomething(s); // &lt;============== COMPILE ERROR
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since there is only one record in the Posts table per Post, use a lock.</p>

<p>Read the record in the Posts table and use a table hint [WITH (ROWLOCK, XLOCKX)] to get an exclusive lock.  Set the lock timeout to wait a few milliseconds.</p>

<p>If the process gets the lock, then it can add the revision record.  If the process cannot get the lock, then have the process try again.  After a few retries if the process cannot get a lock, return an error.</p>

<p>It usually happens when you call dismiss after activity has been closed.</p>

<p>I tried using tight looping for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3270120/javascript-jquery-how-to-make-sure-cross-domain-click-tracking-event-succeeds-be">this</a>. I needed to slow down a native event (which AFAIK is the only use case for a synchronous wait that can't be re-architected asynchronously). There are lots of example loops out there that claim not to lock up the browser; but none of them worked for me (the browser didn't lock up, but they prevented it from doing the thing I was waiting for in the first place), so I abandoned the idea.</p>

<p>Next I tried <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3278300/javascript-how-to-trigger-native-click-action-replay-event-later">this</a> - storing and replaying the event, which seems to be impossible cross-browser too. However depending on the event and how flexible you need to be, you can get close.</p>

<p>In the end I gave up, and feel much better for it; I found a way to make my code work without having to slow down the native event at all.</p>

<p>A simple cubic approximation, the Lagrange polynomial for x ∈ {-1, -½, 0, ½, 1}, is:</p>

<pre><code>double acos(x) {

}

<p>It has a maximum error of about 0.18 rad.</p>

<p>I finally got around to cleaning up a parser I've had in my code folder and posted it on Github:  <a href="http://github.com/davedelong/CHCSVParser" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/davedelong/CHCSVParser</a></p>

<p>It's quite thorough.  It handles all sorts of escaping schemes, newlines in fields, comments, etc.  It also uses intelligent file loading, which means you can safely parse huge files in constrained memory conditions.</p>

<p>I would look into clustering the web end immediately and use that as your primary scaling mechanism. 30k connections is quite a lot and you don't have much room for growth before you hit a server limit of some kind. If the I/O itself isn't onerous I would just use lots of threads and servers with lots of horsepower and memory. Get it working that way so you can ship, and have a fallback plan to switch to multiplexed NIO if performance or scaling becomes a problem, but be warned that it's a radical overhaul and about ten times as complex to program as java.net. After several years' consideration I am more and more wondering whether NIO to economize on threads is really worth it: it adds several new problems of its own such as a need for push parsing; synchronization issues with the selector if there are worker threads that need to change the registration state of channels; lots of ways to get the code wrong; and the fact that the scheduling overhead moves out of the OS into your application, where you only have linear set-iterator data structures to deal with it unless you engage in yet another level of complexity. It's worth remembering that <em>select()</em> was invented for Unix to allow economizing on processes, which are expensive. Threads are pretty cheap really, and provide a very simple programming model with built-in context for handling a single connection. NIO barely manages this at all except via disciplined use of selection key attachments, much less naturally.</p>

<p>I need to convert (0, 128, 64) to something like this #008040. I'm not sure what to call the latter, making searching difficult. </p>

<p>I have integrated a UISearchDisplayController into my controller's xib. The basic functionality I'm going for is to have the search bar in the header of the table, and a button in the navigation bar that shows the search display.</p>

<p>What I'm stuck on: When the cancel is touched, I want to make the searchbar invisible (keep the table so index 0 is show at top, not the search bar), but it stays visible and i'm not sure why (see 3rd image). Any ideas how to always keep the searchbar hidden when the cancel button is touched (see image 1).</p>

<p>What I've tried:</p>

<ol>
<li>Setting the tableview contentOffset to 44. Which works initially.</li>
<li>Calling [tableview scrollToRowAtIndexPath:....], which doesn't seem to do anything.</li>
</ol>

<p>First, the business layer (BL) can and should reside in its' own plugin. That will provide decent decoupling between the layers.</p>

<p>Second, you should carefully decide what the interface should be and which classes are exposed. Ideally, you should mostly expose interfaces and data objects. </p>

<p>Finally, decide how the "hand shake" works. E.g., how to obtain the initial interface to the BL. Since it is a Plugin, it could have an Activator which loads it. You could add a method in the activator which returns the BL interface.</p>

<p>If you are looking for something more decoupled, you could create an extension point or deploy the BL as an OSGi service, but that's a bit of an overkill for you need. </p>

<pre><code>public static &lt;T&gt; void exec(ExecContext&lt;T&gt; ctx)

<p>should do it.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>This should do it... a slight change to how you are doing it though:</p>

<pre><code>public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        final ExecContext&lt;String&gt;  stringCtx;
        final ExecContext&lt;Integer&gt; integerCtx;

        stringCtx  = new ExecContext&lt;String&gt;();
        integerCtx = new ExecContext&lt;Integer&gt;();
        exec(stringCtx, "Hello, World");
        exec(integerCtx, 42);
    }

    public static class ExecContext&lt;T&gt;
    {
        public void doSomething(final T e)
        {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }

    public static &lt;T&gt; void exec(final ExecContext&lt;T&gt; ctx,
                                final T              value)

<p>For Python2.6+, before Python 3.0, the former creates an old-style class while the latter creates a new-style class. In Python 3.0, both create a new-style. The first isn't wrong, but for anything before 3.0 it has different semantics than the latter and is typically discouraged.</p>

<p>I'm playing around with building C# app, really new in C#. What I'm trying to do is; make the app periodically read the content of a text file (in one or two words only). The content of the text file will be handled by other mean, so no issue on that. I'm displaying the content on the Text of System.Windows.Forms.Label(). Right now, it works on Click or HandleCreated event. But I want it to automatically read and display the content in every, say, 2 minutes.</p>

<p>I looked at <a href="http://www.programmingforums.org/post40069.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2928656/c-periodic-data-reading-and-thread-sleep">this</a> but not really sure how to implement it on my case. Anyone can help? Thanks!</p>

<p>Some people find that the directory

<p>FYI: As far as I found from my shallow research with .NET reflector, it seems that the ElementName search searches from the current element upwards, so it's better using RelativeSource and AncestorType (FindAncestor mode).<br>

<p>Blow, you should keep <strong>performance issues</strong> when choosing some kind of inheritance strategy. <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/Inheritance" rel="nofollow">Here</a> you can see a good insight about available inheritance strategies. Do not forget a inheritance can be re-writen as a association as follows</p>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>public class A {}

public class B extends A {}
</code></pre>

<p>you can use</p>

<pre><code>public class B {

    private A a;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can use MapedSuperClass To map all of your inherited properties whitout using any Hibernate/JPA inheritance strategy. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2700680/table-per-subclass-inheritance-relationship-how-to-query-against-the-parent-clas/3017146#3017146">here</a></p>

<p>Keep in mind when using default JPA/Hibernate annotations, Hibernate always fetch all of subclasses. If you have a <strong>single hierarchy</strong>, prefer To use Single Table Inheritance strategy. Joined strategy is better designed when you have a <strong>complex hierarchy</strong> but it suffers due To performance issues when querying for any entity.</p>

'#00-1270f'
</code></pre>

<p>That is a bad thing to be trying to do.  If you don't know what the generic type is going to be, how do you know if passing a <code>String</code> is type-safe?</p>

<p>If you really want to do this, you have to add the appropriate annotation to the <code>exec</code> method to tell it to suppress the unsafe/unchecked type conversion error.  But that is just turning the compilation into a potential <code>ClassCastException</code> at runtime that might be thrown unexpectedly by some subtype of <code>ExecContext</code> that does something different in the <code>doSomething</code> method.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I don't think that the following is correct either:</p>

<pre><code>    public static &lt;T&gt; void exec(ExecContext&lt;T&gt; ctx) {
        String s = new String("saoj");
        ctx.doSomething(s);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>because the compiler cannot tell that the actual type used for <code>T</code> will be <code>String</code> or a (hypothetical) subtype of <code>String</code>.  Suppose for instance that <code>exec</code> was called as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    ExecContext&lt;Integer&gt; ctx = ...;
    exec(ctx);
</code></pre>

<p>Now when <code>exec</code> calls the <code>doSomething</code> method, it will pass a <code>String</code> instance as an argument, where the generic signature of the <code>doSomething</code> method says it should be passing an instance of <code>E</code>; i.e. an <code>Integer</code>.</p>

<p>I found the problem , For Update like that , It's necessary to have primary key . The reason my table didn't have primary key was : I imported those data from an Excel file , So i didn't have Primary key .</p>

<p>On a different tack, there are two other aspects to consider, that may help.</p>

<p>1) Indexes and the indexes used by the SQL.  The indexing strategy used on the tables will affect how many rows are affected.  If you make the data modifications using a unique index, you may reduce the chance of deadlocks.</p>

<p>One algorithm - of course it will not work it all cases.  The use of NOLOCK is targeted rather than being global.</p>

<pre><code>The "old" way:
UPDATE dbo.change_table
   SET somecol = newval
 WHERE non_unique_value = 'something'

The "new" way:
INSERT INTO #temp_table
    SELECT uid FROM dbo.change_table WITH (NOLOCK)
     WHERE non_unique_value = 'something'

UPDATE dbo.change_table
   SET somecol = newval
  FROM dbo.change_table c
       INNER JOIN
       #temp_table t
       ON (c.uid = t.uid)
</code></pre>

<p>2) Transaction duration
The longer a transaction is open the more likely there may be contention.  If there is a way to reduce the amount of time that records remain locked, you can reduce the chances of a deadlock occurring.
For example, perform as many SELECT statements (e.g. lookups) at the start of the code instead of performing an INSERT or UPDATE, then a lookup, then an INSERT, and then another lookup.
This is where one can use the NOLOCK hint for SELECTs on "static" tables that are not changing reducing the lock "footprint" of the code.</p>

<p>I used RegexBuddy for more than half a year. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Hi, I have come across with the following two codes. Why does it not throw an exception for floating point where as in other case it will throw a runtime exception.</p>

<pre><code>class FloatingPoint
    {
      public static void main(String [] args)
       {
         float a=1000f;
         float b=a/0;
        System.out.println("b=" +b);
       }
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>OUTPUT:b=Infinity</strong>.</p>

<p>If I try with int values then it will throw a runtime exception.
Why is it like this?</p>

<p>if I run this...</p>

<pre><code>import ipdb
print 'a'
ipdb.set_trace()
print 'b'
</code></pre>

<p>and then type 'q' to quit I get a 300 line error message.</p>

<p>This will not work because the you are passing the ExecContext (of type unknown) so you don't know at compile what type the ExecutionContext holds.</p>

<p>You will have to do this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Test {

     public static class ExecContext&lt;E&gt; {

         public void doSomething(E e) {

             System.out.println(e);
         }
     }

     public static void exec(ExecContext&lt;Object&gt; ctx) {

         String s = new String("saoj");

         ctx.doSomething(s); // &lt;============== NO COMPILE ERROR
     }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Any way whats the point of generics if you are passing the execution context of unknown or object?</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/ref/regex_match.html" rel="nofollow">boost docs on regex_match</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the result is true only if
  the expression matches the whole of
  the input sequence. If you want to
  search for an expression somewhere
  within the sequence then use
  regex_search.</p>

<pre><code>def clamp(x): 
  return max(0, min(x, 255))

"#{0:02x}{1:02x}{2:02x}".format(clamp(r), clamp(g), clamp(b))
</code></pre>

<p>This uses the preferred method of string formatting, as <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/" rel="nofollow">described in PEP 3101</a>. It also uses <code>min()</code> and <code>max</code> to ensure that <code>0 &lt;= {r,g,b} &lt;= 255</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> added the clamp function as suggested below.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> From the title of the question and the context given, it should be obvious that this expects 3 ints in [0,255] and will always return a color when passed 3 such ints. However, from the comments, this may not be obvious to everyone, so let it be explicitly stated: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Provided three <code>int</code> values, this will return a valid hex triplet representing a color. If those values are between [0,255], then it will treat those as RGB values and return the color corresponding to those values.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could try watching the videos of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2010/" rel="nofollow">WWDC</a>. They have some on both of your questions. It seems Intruments can do a lot of interface questions right now.</p>

<p>Because floats actually <em>have</em> a representation for the "number" you're trying to calculate. So it uses that. An integer has no such representation.</p>

<p>Java (mostly) follows IEEE754 for its floating point support, see <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/typesValues.html#4.2.3" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more details.</p>

<p>I'm looking at installing atmail as a replacement to my home-grown system for internal member-to-member emails on my website.</p>

<p>Currently, these messages are kept in mysql.</p>

<p>All of the IMAP servers I've come across keep emails on the filesystem, I'm guessing there are allot of good reasons that there are not many implementations using mysql as a back end out there.</p>

<p>As far as manageability goes though, I think mysql is the way to go for my site... There are many more tools available for interacting with mysql than for instance mbox files.</p>

<p>Any advice is appreciated.</p>

<p>What are some languages I should study to create a Chatroom?</p>

<p>Hello again...</p>

<p>I have a widget which is a TimePicker that retrieves the time saved in a field in a database.</p>

<p>Thing is that when the user changes the time value in the widget, this is not being saved in the database.</p>

<p>So I came across the <strong>setOnTimeChangedListener</strong> method that works like a charm, if you are only using the plus and minus signs in the widget.  It does not capture the change if you are using the keyword.</p>

<p>Here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>pickedTime.setOnTimeChangedListener(new TimePicker.OnTimeChangedListener() {

        public void onTimeChanged(TimePicker arg0, int arg1, int arg2) {
            System.out.println("What time is it? "
                    + String.valueOf(arg0.getCurrentHour()) + ":"
                    + String.valueOf(arg0.getCurrentMinute()));
        }

    });
</code></pre>

<p>I've also tried unsuccessfully:</p>

<p><strong>pickedTime.setOnFocusChangeListener</strong> and <strong>pickedTime.setOnKeyListener</strong> methods.  </p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Looking for 401 codes won't reliably catch them as sites might not produce links to anything you don't have privileges for. That is, until you are logged in, it won't show you anything you need to log in for. OTOH some sites (ones with all static content for example) manage to pop a login dialog box for some pages so looking for password input tags would also miss stuff.</p>

<p>My advice: find a spider program that you can get source for, add in whatever tests (plural) you plan on using and make it stop of the first positive result. Look for a spider that can be throttled <em>way</em> back, can ignore non HTML files (maybe by making HEAD requests and looking at the mime type) and can work with more than one site independently and simultaneously.</p>

<p>Consider using the REVERSE function.  If you reverse the string, then the position of the first space in the reversed string can be subtracted from the length of the normal string to calculate the starting position of NNN/MMM.</p>

<p>The method has worked well for me for parsing file paths.  Reversing the string and looking for the first "\" in the reversed string indicates where the path ends and the file name begins.</p>

<p>If your data is as well formatted as you indicate, this method may be more trouble than some  others.  But when the beginning data is "haphazard", this method can really simplify things.</p>

<p>This should get you started:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
  function cb(response) {
    var props = {};
    var properties = response['/en/colonel_sanders'].result.properties;
    for (var p_id in properties) {
      var prop = properties[p_id];
      props[prop.text]=prop.values[0].text;
    }
    console.log(props);
  }
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>I have created an application that loads a website using WebView. Everything works fine except that I'm unable to play any video files within the application. So, what I'm looking for help on is getting my application to launch the mediaplayer when I click on a link ending with .mp4. Any help and tips would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>This is because the compiler is implicitly declaring a copy constructor for class <code>foo</code>. <code>std::wstringstream</code> is noncopyable, because it inherits from <code>ios_base</code>.</p>

<p>Change your class to this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;sstream&gt;

class foo
{
  public:
    void methodA(int x, int y); // Uses mBufferStream
    void methodB(int x, int y); // Uses mBufferStream

  private:
    std::wstringstream mBufferStream;
    foo(const foo&amp;); //noncopyable
    void operator=(const foo&amp;)
};
</code></pre>

<p>and the compiler should point you at the culprit.</p>

<p>Hi,

<p>In the timer event mentioned in another answer, I expect you will want to read the file every time, even if some other process is currently locking the file.  </p>

<p>But if you don't take precautions you will receive an exception whenever the file is in use. You can catch this exception of course, but you will then need to simply wait for a few seconds before trying again.  If the file is still locked you may need to implement some timeout mechanism.</p>

<p>If this is not what you want, another approach that supports reading of (possibly) locked files is to use a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.filestream.aspx" rel="nofollow">FileStream</a> object created with the FileShare.ReadWrite parameter:</p>

<pre><code>        // Inside your timer event.
        using (System.IO.FileStream fs = new System.IO.FileStream("yourfile.log", 
               System.IO.FileMode.Open, System.IO.FileAccess.Read, 
               System.IO.FileShare.ReadWrite))
        {
            // use fs to read from file as required
        }

<p>ok here is the code</p>

<pre><code>  - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
        #pragma mark parse DetailXml

        //XMLAppDelegate *appDelegate=(XMLAppDelegate*)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
        Book *aBook = [appDelegate.books objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]; i need this to get id form XMLa

        **uuidd=aBook.uniqueId;** this i need 

        if(bdvController == nil)


        //  Book *aBook = [appDelegate.books objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];



            bdvController = [[BookDetailViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"BookDetailView" bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]];



        //XMLAppDelegate *appDelegate=(XMLAppDelegate*)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;

        //Book *aBook = [appDelegate.books objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
    DetailXml   *aDetail=[appDelegate.dxml objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];**i want this as my next table secition view will be based on this XMlb  but i am gettingf index out of bound
        bdvController.aDetail = aDetail;**


then here xml paresing is done then this
[self.navigationController pushViewController:bdvController animated:YES];



}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>i am getting index Out of bound if i do this    DetailXml <em>aDetail=[appDelegate.dxml objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];</em></strong></p>

<p>alright first off i will say that im definitely newer to android programming than most.. i think that i am picking up quite quickly however i think that the program that im looking to eventually create is a bit out of my league right now considering my level of knowledge.. im hoping someone here can either tell me what i need to do so i can do my research and start working or maybe even provide me with some sample source code to work from</p>

<p>i have figured out how to do everything in my android program except for creating a list that is populated by an internet file that i update and maintain on a daily basis.. i dont care what file type it is.. i can learn to use whatever if it gets the job done.. the program reads the information from the file, properly splits it up into an array (multiple actually considering there are multiple parts that accompany each item in the list), and creates the list with the items - each of which are clickable and sends you to a separate page/activity with the full information of that item that you clicked on</p>

<p>any help with this would be greatly greatly appreciated</p>

<p>I have two <code>double[] X</code> and <code>double[] Y</code>.<br>
I want to create a new array Z, where each Zi = Xi * Yi</p>

<p>I wonder if it's possible to do with LINQ?<br>
(I'm learning LINQ now; of course I can use plain for).</p>

<p>As André said, you may want to implement an HttpResponse filter. Alternatively to configuring the filter in the web.config file, you can also implement the following in the global.asax.cs file:</p>

<pre><code>  protected void Application_BeginRequest() {
     Response.Filter = new PassThroughFilter(Response.Filter);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>PassThroughFilter</code> class derives from Stream and implements the abstract methods, then forwards them to the original filter.</p>

<p>For the full source code, see <a href="http://manfredlange.blogspot.com/2010/07/using-http-response-filter-in-aspnet.html" rel="nofollow">my blog</a>.</p>

<p>Let's say we define an anonymous hash like this:</p>

<pre><code>my $hash = {};
</code></pre>

<p>And then use the hash afterwards. Then it's time to empty or clear the hash for
reuse. After some Google searching, I found:</p>

<pre><code>%{$hash} = () 
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>undef %{$hash}
</code></pre>

<p>Both will serve my needs. My question is, what's the difference between the two? Are they both identical ways to empty a hash?</p>

<p>I'm trying to create a rdlc report in Visual Studio 2008 and I'm having a bit of trouble with the totals at the end.</p>

<p>I have a string field called "Reward" that displays either 1, 2, 3 or B.  At the end of the report, I need to count up how many total records, how many "B"s and how many are not "B"s.  So my inclination is to have three fields at the bottom as such:</p>

<pre><code>Total      =COUNT(IIF(Fields!Reward.Value &gt; "a",1,0))
Bs         =COUNT(IIF(Fields!Reward.Value = "B",1,0))
Non-Bs     =COUNT(IIF(Fields!Reward.Value &lt;&gt; "B",1,0))
</code></pre>

<p>But all three end up equaling the same (the total record count).  I thought that seemed weird so I tried data that doesn't appear in that column at all such as </p>

<pre><code>=COUNT(IIF(Fields!Reward.Value = "4",1,0))
</code></pre>

<p>and I still get the same number.  Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?</p>

<p>It's possible at 4.0, using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd267698.aspx" rel="nofollow">Zip</a> (that's the definition of zip - combining elements on the same position):</p>

<pre><code>double[] Z = X.Zip(Y, (x, y) =&gt; x * y).ToArray();
</code></pre>

<p>On 3.5 you can use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/morelinq/" rel="nofollow">MoreLinq</a>, which has a custom Zip extension method.</p>

<p>What does the log say? That the application has terminated successfully with return code 0x0?</p>

<p>If you did not put anything to stop the application it might be that it runs good and terminates without you noticing it. Try to add a <code>scanf</code> or <code>Sleep(5000)</code> after the <code>printf</code> statement so things will be visible. You can also compile it in <code>debug</code> mode and put a breakpoint after the printf statement and see the results.</p>

<p>In addition, I am not too familiar with Windows Mobile and its incarnations (smart phone 2003 being one of them), but I am not sure how it handles a <code>printf</code>. You can try create an MFC application and use the <code>MessageBox</code> to display your text.</p>

<hr>

<p>OK. I just tried the two options and there is no CMD windows in Windows Mobile (Smartphone or PocketPC) so the application runs successfully, but prints nothing.</p>

<p>Use the MFC option or deploy your application to a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=a120e012-ca31-4be9-a3bf-b9bf4f64ce72&amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">Windows CE 5.0 device emulator</a> image. I have not tried that download myself, but it says that it should save you the hassle of handling Platform Builder. Note that you might be missing some components in the image down the road, but I suppose that for practicing purposes it should suite you just fine.</p>

<p>If the function is actually going to modify the string, you'd better create a separate copy:</p>

<pre><code>std::string str = // ...
char* cstr = strdup(str.c_str());
MyMethod(cstr);
// If you want to preserve the changes made:
// str = cstr;
free(cstr);
</code></pre>

<p>In C is there a branch-less technique to compute the absolute difference between two unsigned ints? For example given the variables a and b, I would like the value 2 for cases when a=3, b=5 or b=3, a=5. Ideally I would also like to be able to vectorize the computation using the SSE registers.</p>

<p>I hope one of these RCS's will add narrow clone capability.  My understanding is that the architecture of GIT (changes/moves tracked across the whole repo) makes this very difficult.</p>

<p>Bazaar prides itself on supporting many different types of workflows.  Lack of narrow clone capability prohibits an SVN/CVS like workflow in bzr/hg/git, so I'm hoping they'll be motivated to find some way to do this.</p>

<p>New features shouldn't come at the expense of basic functionality, like the ability to fetch a single file/directory from the repo.  The "distributed" feature of modern rcs's is "cool," but in my opinion discourages good development practices (frequent merges / continuous integration).  These new RCS's all seem to lack very basic functionality.  Even SVN without real branching/tagging support seemed like a step backwards from CVS imo.</p>

<p>The exception indicates that you're missing some classes (one or more JAR files, presumably) when you run your program, though they're either irrelevant to compiling it or they <em>are</em> available then.</p>

<p>You should also note that the first line in <code>appendDb</code> accomplishes nothing. It builds a new <code>List</code> by consing <code>database</code> onto the front of the <code>List</code> referred to by <code>db</code>, but the resulting value is discarded. Perhaps you meant this:</p>

<pre><code>  db = database :: db
</code></pre>

<p>You might try using cURL and just attempting to connect to each site in turn (possibly put them in a text file and read each line, try to connect, repeat). </p>

<p>You can set up one of the callbacks to check the HTTP response code and do whatever you need from there.</p>

<p>Since your question is tagged jQuery here's a slightly shorter answer using that library:</p>

<pre><code>function copy(from, to) {
    from.children().each(function() {
      var match = to.children("." + this.className.split(' ').join('.'));
        if(match.length) {
            if(match.children().length == 0) {
                match.replaceWith(this);
            } else {
                copy($(this), match);
            }
        } else {
            to.append(this);
        }
    }).end().remove();
    from.remove();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you'd just call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>copy($(".container1"), $(".container2"));
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/nick_craver/BMUPu/" rel="nofollow">You can give it a try here</a>, the result is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="container container2"&gt;
  &lt;div class="cars"&gt;
    &lt;div class="sedans"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="vans"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="drinks"&gt;
    &lt;div class="soda"&gt;coke&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="coffee"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="juice"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="colors"&gt;
    &lt;div class="blue"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="red"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the class name is still <code>container2</code> if you want to replace that just add this  to switch the class after the <code>copy()</code> call:</p>

<pre><code>$(".container2").toggleClass("container2 container-result");
</code></pre>

<p>The match is based on all classes the element contains, so if an element has <code>class="car blue"</code> and there's a corresponding <code>class="blue car"</code> it'll choose that one to overwrite.</p>

<p>This isn't the most efficient route since you're firing up the selector engine on the children each iteration, but unless you're doing <em>lots</em> of elements, it should be pretty quick.</p>

<p>I really like sql-database in HTML5, but so far only <a href="http://html5demos.com/" rel="nofollow">Opera and Webkit browsers support this feature</a>. Are there any javascript libraries out there that replicate this feature or provide something close to this?</p>

<p>I'm trying to load some images in table cells asynchronously using ASINetworkQueue. I just can't figure it out and can't seem to find a good SIMPLE example. </p>

<p>The best I can find is this, but its just totally overkill and a little too complicated for me:

<p>Does anyone else have any tips/solutions/code for doing this with the ASIHTTPRequest library?</p>

<p>I want to have a browser page which shows the video from both a local and a remote IP based web cam simultaneously. </p>

<p>It will also have a few standard HTML form elemts and a "submit" button for user control of the local camera, etc</p>

<p>It may later also need show the output of a remote data measurement device, recevied locally over RS232.</p>

<p>Now, I presoanlly prefer server side solutions (YMMV), because users can turn off JS, or even edit it if they are mailicious or stupid. Can I do it in PHP? I know PHP reasonably well, so that would save me learnnig a new language. I am just a little worried about refreshing the page for that remote measurement data. </p>

<p>It has to be cross-platform, which is why I am thinking browser based. Can I do it browser-based, or should I go with Java, or what?</p>

<p>For most major sites that you can preform CRUD operations does each user have their own database table? I would love to see an example of a database structure which multiple users, I'm looking at my wordpress database structure and just can't picture how twitter, tumblr, or even stackoverflow actually runs a database. Is it that easy to create a table for a user dynamically? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Did C# provide any method to compare the string with a
wildcard pattern like. Or I can say I want to find a "Like Operator" to do string comparison.
Suppose I have a string .I also have a paragraph , I want to find the string on this parapgraph,But how.In SQL we can do it just using the <strong>LIKE</strong> operator.</p>

<p><strong>Any Suggestion  and reply is grateful.</strong></p>

<p>Looking for password fields will get you so far, but won't help with sites that use HTTP authentication. Looking for 401s will help with HTTP authentication, but won't get you sites that don't use it, or ones that don't return 401. Looking for links like "log in" or "username" fields will get you some more.</p>

<p>I don't think that you'll be able to do this entirely automatically and be sure that you're actually detecting all the password-protected areas.</p>

<p>You'll probably want to take a library that is good at web automation, and write a little program yourself that reads the list of target sites from a file, checks each one, and writes to one file of "these are definitely passworded" and "these are not", and then you might want to go manually check the ones that are not, and make modifications to your program to accomodate. Using httrack is great for grabbing data, but it's not going to help with detection -- if you write your own "check for password protected area" program with a general purpose HLL, you can do more checks, and you can avoid generating more requests per site than would be necessary to determine that a password-protected area exists.</p>

<p>You may need to ignore robots.txt</p>

<p>I recommend using <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/" rel="nofollow">the python port of perls mechanize</a>, or whatever nice web automation library your preferred language has. Almost all modern languages will have a nice library for opening and searching through web pages, and looking at HTTP headers.</p>

<p>If you are not capable of  writing this yourself, you're going to have a rather difficult time using httrack or wget or similar and then searching through responses.</p>

<p>Hi, on Git, say I mess up my commits, and I want to make the version 3 commits ago as the new version. If I do "git checkout xxxx", it creates a new branch and it seems like I can only merge it? Could I make this the new "master version"?</p>

<p>I want:</p>

<pre><code>A-B-C-D-E
</code></pre>

<p>to become</p>

<pre><code>A-B-C-D-E-F
</code></pre>

<p>where F has exactly the same content as C</p>

<p>If I use "git revert xxxx" instead, it seems like it definitely will have conflicts and I need to manually resolve it. What I really want is just make the old commit at some point the new commit, irregardless of what's in my working directory or the latest commit. How would I go about doing this? Thank you.</p>

<p>It validates a credit-card number by using the checksum algorithm.</p>

<p>From the wiki page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The formula verifies a number against
  its included check digit, which is
  usually appended to a partial account
  number to generate the full account
  number. This account number must pass
  the following test:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Counting from the check digit, which is the rightmost, and moving
  left, double the value of every second
  digit.</li>
  <li>Sum the digits of the products together with the undoubled digits
  from the original number.</li>
  <li>If the total ends in 0 (put another way, if the total modulo 10 is
  equal to 0), then the number is valid
  according to the Luhn formula; else it
  is not valid.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Assume an example of an account number
  "4992739871" that will have a check
  digit added, making it of the form
  4992739871x:</p>

<p>There are multiple different types of databases, but typically not. More commonly, you would have a single table, but with a field that designates the user ID. In MySQL, you can select the subset of rows for which the user ID matches  a specific value, which is kind of like dynamically creating a per-user table.</p>

<p>You can look in the c code (array.c)
if it calls any ruby method calls (rb_funcall) then it's not thread safe, I believe.  Otherwise it should be...</p>

<p>You could easily override #pop et al and make them have their own synchronization.</p>

<p>Why would each user have their own table?  A user should simply be an entry in a table.  You then use the id of that user to look up other records in other tables.</p>

<p>If you database contained sy 6 tables then each time you added a user youd also have to add the other tables again too.</p>

<p>so now you have 10 users and 60 tables.</p>

<p>While interviewing for a company, I was asked to submit several code samples that highlight my "best" work. I was pinged back with several questions regarding a specific code sample, one of which alluded to a bug.</p>

<p>The code sample was a WCF Web service that uses AES to encrypt an opaque blob. The blob is used by the service to identify all resources for a specific service request. The bug was that the .NET RijndaelManaged class was used with CBC mode, without properly setting the IV. The RijndaelManaged class will autogenerate an appropriate IV during class instantiation, which in the code sample, occurs during first usage of encryption, and is persisted for the life of the ASP .NET Application. Since ASP.NET applications can be restarted for a variety of reasons, it's possible that a these opaque blobs would be "invalidated" from one service call to the next because of a new IV value generated during App startup (the bug).</p>

<p>The question itself was "where is IV set for decryption?"</p>

<p>My response is already to admit that this is a bug; but since they asked for my "best" work, <strong>am I SOL on this position for having submitted a sample with a bug? Is there more I can say?</strong></p>

<p>I'm hesitant to outline the situation because I don't want to seem like I'm making an excuse, but the encryption code was turned off while our service was in pre-alpha, and the project was killed before we ever went into production.</p>

<p>Wildcards are a complicated beast (a form of regular expressions), but it sounds like you want the <code>Contains</code> method. You can just do <code>paragraph.Contains(sentence)</code>.</p>

<p>It sounds like you just want to reset to C; that is make the tree:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A-B-C</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can do that with <code>reset</code>:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~3
</code></pre>

<p><sub>(Note: You said three commits ago so that's what I wrote; in your example C is only two commits ago, so you might want to use <code>HEAD~2</code>)</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>You can also use <code>revert</code> if you want, although as far as I know you need to do the reverts one at a time:</p>

<pre><code>git revert HEAD     # Reverts E
git revert HEAD~2   # Reverts D
</code></pre>

<p>That will create a new commit F that's the same contents as D, and G that's the same contents as C. You can <code>rebase</code> to squash those together if you want</p>

<p>Is your User model valid? If it's not, the validation will fail and the column can't be saved.</p>

<p>In Joda I saw that <code>Instant</code> class extends <code>AbstractInstant</code> and implements <code>Readable</code> which is already implemented in <code>AbstractInstant</code>. What is the reason behind this?. </p>

<p>I have a simple program that lets you add, edit, list, search and delete records by storing it on arrays.</p>

<p>My problem now, is how to properly delete items on it. Here is my current code. </p>

<pre><code>System.out.print("Input number to delete: ");
                    delnum=scanz.nextLine();
                    intdelnum=Integer.parseInt(delnum);

 name[intdelnum]=null;
                            course[intdelnum]=null;
                            gender[intdelnum]=null;
                            school[intdelnum]=null;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, if I list this array which contains 10 elements each. The array index which Ive set to  null, will remain null forever. And I cannot add anything on it. 
Do you know of a better way on how to do this. So that when I delete the array element at index 2. The element at index 3 will go up. to index 2? So that later I could still add an element on the index which I've set to null.</p>

<p>Another important difference between the Zend Engine and a typical JVM is in the way they execute bytecodes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Zend Engine executes (interprets) the compiled bytecodes directly.  (At least that's what I think happens.  I wasn't able to confirm this from the Zend online documentation!)</li>
<li>A JVM will normally use a JIT compiler to compile bytecodes to native instructions, and then execute the native instructions.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Actually, JVM behaviour is more complicated than this.  JVMs don't always compile to native code, and when they do, they typically delay JIT compilation until they figure it is worth doing.  Prior to that, they execute the bytecodes directly.</p>

<p>I need to return an IEnumerable of a dynamically created Dictionary.</p>

<p>pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code>var x = from u in Users

select new dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;{
    Add("Name",u.Name),
    Add("LastName",u.LastName)
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've been trying many ways to get the pseudo code example above but no success...</p>

<p>I would really appreciate your help.</p>

<p>This is just an idea (not really an answer but I can't comment).</p>

<p>Since it seems from the error message that there is a parameter given to <code>py2exe</code> that it doesn't accept, I'd guess it's the <code>-q</code> parameter. So try removing the line <code>sys.argv.append("-q")</code> and run the scrip then. </p>

<p>I haven't used py2exe myself so I can't really test this. It's just an idea.</p>

<p>I would basically just state exactly what you said here. Stating your understanding of the bug, why it's a bug, what its effects would be, and its solution is the best way to reassert your competence as a programmer.</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>

<p>I am using Windows XP and installed Zend Server Community Edition 5.0.2.</p>

<p>Please refer to 
<a href="http://wiki.mpsoftware.dk/doku.php/tutorials/zend_framework_in_phpdesigner_7" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.mpsoftware.dk/doku.php/tutorials/zend_framework_in_phpdesigner_7</a>
/////////////
Create a new project in phpDesigner 7 from the menu Project > Project Manager. Under 'Libraries', add the path to Zend Framework. Now load the new project from either the 'Project Manager' > 'Load Project' or the menu Project. You can now work with all the classes, functions and variables listed in Zend Framework inside phpDesigner 7. 
/////////////</p>

<p>Q1> which library folder I should provide for phpDesigner?
I found the following two folders under my machine
C:\Program Files\Zend\ZendServer\GUI\library
C:\Program Files\Zend\ZendServer\share\ZendFramework\library</p>

<p>Q2> It seems that the home directory is
C:\Program Files\Zend\Apache2\htdocs
Then, how can my PHP script on above folder to access these Zend Libraries?</p>

<p>Q3> The structure of my local machine is different from my deployment environment (i.e. hosting company).</p>

<p>Is there a easy way that I can avoid some deployment problems caused by this inconsistent path collisions?</p>

<p>Thank you </p>

<p>Alright, this pretty much goes along with my previous question. I'm still trying to figure out how to display data from an array which is created by a PHP file- using JS/jQuery. I'm working on a points system for ZetaBoards, and I've currently got it set up <a href="http://s1.zetaboards.com/RyJoe/index/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. (Points will be displayed below the users post count once I get this working.. you guys can't see the +/- functions which work fine, haha. :p )</p>

<p><a href="http://outlinetokens.hostei.com/scripts/output.php" rel="nofollow">http://outlinetokens.hostei.com/scripts/output.php</a></p>

<p>So, for each user- I can get their user ID, I just don't know how to check if their name is in the array. (and if it is, display their points) I'm guessing I'll have to do something like this? Here's the chunk of the code that deals with this.. you'll see where I need help.</p>

<pre><code>if (location.href.match('/topic/')) {
    $.getScript('http://outlinetokens.hostei.com/scripts/output.php', function () {
        $('td.c_username a.member').each(function () {
            value = 0;
            u = $(this).attr('href').split('profile/')[1].split('/')[0];

            // this is where I need to do the 'search.' Just a basic guess.. help. D:

            if (values.uid == u) {
                value = values.points;
            }

            $(this).parents('tr').next().find('dl.user_info').append('&lt;dt&gt;' + options.system_name + ':&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd class="Points"&gt;&lt;span id="point_total"&gt;' + value + '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;');
        });
    })
}

<p>You need to override the <code>shouldOverrideUrlLoading</code> method of your webViewCient...</p>

<pre><code>final class MyWebViewClient extends WebViewClient {
    @Override
    public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {
        if (url.endsWith(".mp4") {
            Intent intent = new Intent("android.intent.action.VIEW", Uri.parse(url));
            view.getContext().startActivity(intent);
            return true;
        } else {
            return super.shouldOverrideUrlLoading(view, url);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>... that you assign to your webview:</p>

<pre><code>WebViewClient webViewClient = new MyWebViewClient();
webView.setWebViewClient(webViewClient);
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:
also important that you add:</p>

<pre><code>webView.getSettings().setAllowFileAccess(true);
</code></pre>

<p>to allow file downloads/streams such as mp4 files.</p>

<p>write a directshow filter that splits it into two audio outputs?</p>

<p>You could do it manually by shifting the array contents around, or by using an array copying call like <code>System.arraycopy</code>, but you almost certainly want to use a collection instead. <a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html" rel="nofollow"><code>ArrayList</code></a> is a good choice for a mutable array. <a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html#remove(int)" rel="nofollow"><code>ArrayList.remove</code></a> will let you remove by index:</p>

<pre><code>ArrayList&lt;...&gt; name, course, gender, school;

intdelnum = Integer.parseInt(delnum);
name.remove(intdelnum);
course.remove(intdelnum);
gender.remove(intdelnum);
school.remove(intdelnum);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Some other random notes about your code snippet:</p>

<p>I'm assuming <code>scanz</code> is a Scanner. You can call <code>nextInt()</code> on it instead of using <code>nextLine()</code> and converting the String to an int.</p>

<p>You also probably want to make a class that holds all that information, instead of using four parallel arrays to track it:</p>

<pre><code>class Student {
    enum Gender {MALE, FEMALE}

    private String name;
    private Course course; // This can be a String if that's simpler for your project
    private Gender gender;
    private School school; // See note for 'course'
}

ArrayList&lt;Student&gt; students;

<p>Hey all- </p>

<p>Something is strange with my CSS - I'm still picking up the basics so if someone can help that would be great! </p>

<p>I want the navmenu on this <a href="http://www.annapogossova.com" rel="nofollow">link text</a> to align to the right of the site - 
Doe's anyone know which tag I should be editing? 
The Ul/Li of the drop down menu has me confused! </p>

<p>I'm doing a homework assignment where I need to display an image and then allow the user to resize the image witha JSlider. I have the image displaying, but Im not sure how I could use a slider to change the size. As I understand sliders, there are 3 parameters that control the default value, the max slider value, and the min slider value.</p>

<p>Could I reference these numbers in some kind of equation that determines what dimensions to set the image at??</p>

<p>Also, I need scrollbars if the image is bigger than the frame. currently my scrollbars will show up but the image will still stretch the frame to just below the size of the image. is there somewhere i can set the dimension limits for the scrolling? this is what I'm trying unsuccessfully at the moment:</p>

<pre><code>JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(image);
        scrollPane.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(500,500));
        scrollPane.setBounds(frame.getWidth()-image.getWidth(), 0, frame.getHeight()-image.getHeight(), frame.getHeight());
        frame.add(scrollPane);
</code></pre>

<p>You can't resize the array once it is created.<br>
You can create a  List  from the array like <code>Arrays.asList()</code>, use <code>remove()</code> to remove elements you don't want and then use <code>toArray()</code> to get back an array from the List.</p>

<p>As I understand it you have two problems here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Because of the new sorting code in JTable, your sorting does not work.</li>
<li>Even if you disable sorting by <code>setRowSorter(null)</code> or by overriding the <code>setRowSorter(TableRowsorter)</code> to do nothing, it does not work because the events on header are not passed to your JTable.</li>
</ol>

<p>In that case I think the option for you is to just <strong>have your sorting code implemented as TableRowSorter</strong>. I am not aware how complex your sorting code is and whether it can map the TableRowSorter API, but this seems to be one more alternative you can try.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say it would damage your monitor since there are programs that do this in an attempt to fix dead pixels. I can't remember any off the top of my head since I haven't used one in 3 years. </p>

<p>So it shouldn't do much, but then again you wouldn't be running this for extended periods of time, would you?</p>

<p>Your post is pretty vague, but based on what you said I'd create a model for Company that has_many users.</p>

<p>Making sure that each user could only see data from their company would be as simple as limiting the data results to that company.  Your index could look like:</p>

<pre><code> before_filter :current_company
    def index
      @data = @current_company.data.find(:all)
      respond_to do |format|
         format.html
      end
    end
</code></pre>

<p>Limiting admin abilities to their own companies could be done with:</p>

<pre><code>@data = @current_user.company.data.find(params[:id])
</code></pre>

<p>This prevents them from editing anything outside their company because if they try it'll just return a record not found error.  Note that this could be cleaner, but you get the idea.</p>

<p>This railscast on subdomains will probably point you in the right direction: <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/123-subdomains" rel="nofollow">http://railscasts.com/episodes/123-subdomains</a> (I like using subdomains because it feels cleaner to me, but it's not necessary and you can still use most of the rest)</p>

<p>Everyone writes bugs. Part of your job as a programmer is how you deal with those bugs. I would try outlining the situation, fixing the bug, and resubmitting your code, just like you would at the job. After that, it depends on the company and how they make their hiring decisions. If it were me, however, and you showed initiative and took responsibility by following up on and fixing the bug, I don't know if it would be a deal breaker. In fact, it could turn a negative into a positive.</p>

<pre><code>var x = from u in Users
        select new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; {
            { "Name", u.Name },
            { "LastName", u.LastName }
        };
</code></pre>

<p>It returns a different result only when (x + 1) causes a loss of precision, that is, x is many orders of magnitude larger or smaller than one.</p>

<p>But I don't think this is <em>tricky</em> or <em>sleight of hand</em>, I think it's just plain <strong>wrong</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>cos(0) = 1 but f(1) = -pi/2
cos(pi/2) = 0 but f(0) = 0
cos(pi) = -1 but f(-1) = pi/2
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>f(x)</code> is Vincent's <code>arccos</code> implementation.  All of them are off by <code>pi/2</code>, a linear approximation that gets at least these three points correct would be</p>

<pre><code>g(x) = (1 - x) * pi / 2
</code></pre>

<p>I don't see the details instantly, but think about what happens as x approaches 1 or -1 from either side, and consider roundoff error.</p>

<p>I'd still like to see an answer to this question, but I've worked around it by name-mangling the relationship accessors (e.g. '_otherentity' instead of 'otherentity') and then filtering on the name.  Works fine for my purposes.</p>

<p>Your question is a little unclear, but what I think you are asking is why your movie is not playing when the application launches before the user sees the controls and items in your XIB file. If this is correct, then this is the normal behavior as typically the application will launch and only then call the function you have (applicationDidFinishLaunching). There is no guarantee that you will get that function called before the controls have loaded and are viewable on the screen all the time.</p>

<p>It is bad form to start you application with a movie, but if you want to then you have to deal with the fact that there will potentially be a default image or even your controls that you put in your XIB file. </p>

<p>One way to start with a movie, is that you must hide or delete everything in the XIB file so the screen will appear blank when the application loads. Then, when you application calls the applicationDidFinishLaunching function the user will not have seen your application and the first thing they will see is the movie. When the movie is finished playing, you will need to have a notification listener instruct your application to show the controls for your application or switch to another XIB file that has the app controls within it.</p>

<p>I hope this helps. </p>

<p>I'm not sure if I'm reading your question right, but you can <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/" rel="nofollow">load JSON with jQuery</a>, instead of a script.</p>

<p>If then, the array is one of usernames, you can just use <code>response.hasOwnProperty(username)</code> or similar to check if it's in the JSON object you got back</p>

<p>Also, in php use <code>json_encode</code></p>

<p>Addition causes that both numbers are normalized (in this case, relevant for x). IIRC, in Knuth's volume 2, in the chapter on floating-point arithmetic, you can even see an expression like x+0.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have to perform some custom bytecode transformation. 
I have used mainly asm and javaassit.</p>

<p>Inside eclipse usually I run my code with the -javaagent jvm parameter. Outside eclipse I use maven, ant, or the command prompt to invoke the weavers before running the application code.</p>

<p>But the point is that: I would like to perform instrumentation at build time inside eclipse.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the best way to do it?</li>
<li>Is there an already made plugin that I can connect to by implementing some api?</li>
<li>May I script this with eclipse monkey?</li>
<li>May I use an ant builder and invoke my weaver with it?</li>
<li>Should I look at the AspectJ plugin (must be huge) and try to figure out how to make my own plugin?</li>
<li>Should I look at the some other plugin to get inspiration?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Why are these lines in your data formatted like this:</p>

<pre><code>{'uid','342230','name','Joe','points','250'}
</code></pre>

<p>instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>{'uid': '342230', 'name': 'Joe', 'points','250'}
</code></pre>

<p>If that was formatted correctly you could access the properties.</p>

<p>You want <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/" rel="nofollow">JQuery.parseJSON</a>.  Load the data string, parse it, and assuming its valid JSON, it will become a JS object. Then just access the members in the usual way.</p>

<p>I'm doing research for making a chat based app for the iPhone (it's not really text chat in the regular sense, but the principles are the same). </p>

<p>Maximum 6 people can be logged into the same chat room at any one time, and the most basic question is how to efficiently check for new messages? </p>

<p>Would I need to simply poll the server periodically? Or is there a way I could trigger an event on the phone from the server whenever there is some new content to pay attention to?</p>

<p>If having to poll all the time, I worry about the resulting lag as each participant will have to wait longer for others before they can post their own responses to others. And, potentially it might also be too much to handle for the server to respond to lots of requests all the time. It would also waste bandwidth, which is not free for the user...</p>

<p>Unfortunately I will not be able to set up a socket server for this app, it has to be based around a regular LAMP configuration.</p>

<p>maybe your compile is keeping its reference in a registry instead of the stack...there is some way mentioned I think in README.EXT to force an object to never be GC'ed, but...the question still remains as to why it's being collected early...</p>

<p>In my case I want to write an app which is totally symetrical (not client-server) with identical functionality at two PCs, one a 'standard' Windows or Linxu box and the other an Android slate.</p>

<p>Can I run the same program on both or do I nneed to wrap it in an Android package for persmissioons, etc? </p>

<p>The two PCs will communciate by TCP/IP, sort of peer-to-peer, but I suspect that as a generic question this might be of interest to many.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>This is my jsf code :-</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;h:commandButton id="cmdLogin" value="Login" actionListener="#{indexBean.login}"&gt;
                            &lt;f:ajax execute="@form" render="@all" /&gt;
                        &lt;/h:commandButton&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is my login method of indexBean :-</p>

<pre><code> public void login(){

                HttpServletResponse objHttpServletResponse = (HttpServletResponse)FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().getResponse();
                objHttpServletResponse.sendRedirect("Restricted/Home.jsf");

    }
</code></pre>

<p>I get one alert in javascript <code>emptyResponse: An empty response was received from the server.  Check server error logs.</code>. Why does this type of redirect not work?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :-</strong>
Interestingly, when i redirect from faces-config.xml, it works!</p>

<pre><code>&lt;faces-config version="2.0"
    xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

            &lt;redirect/&gt;
        &lt;/navigation-case&gt;
    &lt;/navigation-rule&gt;

&lt;/faces-config&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And obviously, i changed <code>actionListener</code> of commandbutton to <code>action</code> and changed return type of <code>login</code> to <code>String</code> and returned <code>home</code> from login method. Can anybody tell now, if this is the desired behaviour in JSF ? How come redirect  from <code>faces-config.xml</code> works and simple redirect in managedbean doesn't?</p>

<p>I already answered to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303696/mapping-lookup-tables">your question here</a> a few days ago about what's the right thing to do: <strong>map the relationships as proper relationships</strong>.</p>

<p>That is poor use of a dictionary - you're only using it as a property bag, and create as many dictionaries as users.<br>
A better use of the language would be creating your own <code>User</code> class with these properties and use that:</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }

<p>And the query:</p>

<pre><code>var users = Users.Select(u =&gt; new User
            {
                Name = u.Name,
                LastName = u.LastName
            });
</code></pre>

<p>If you'll only use the collection whiting your method, another option is to create an anonymous class:</p>

<pre><code>var users = Users.Select(u =&gt; new { Name = u.Name, LastName = u.LastName });
</code></pre>

<p>In my case it was a wrong content-type header "image/jpg" sent with PHP-generated image. Double requests gone after I changed the type to "image/jpeg"</p>

<p>Accident.</p>

<p>It doesn't make any difference either way.  Either there's a historical reason -- AbstractInstant was refectored out and the author left Readable in the subclass for backward compatibility -- or it was just a harmless oopsie.</p>

<p>I confess, I'm a greedy programmer. I'm easily excited by various languages/technologies/platform, and then want to learn and master them all. Well, it seems to be a good habit, but no one can learn everything, so I need to focus and concentrate on something most important.</p>

<p>Here's the list of things I would love to learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python (scripting)</li>
<li>F# (functional language)</li>
<li>Deeper C#/.NET </li>
<li>SQL Server (both development and administration)</li>
<li>WPF</li>
<li>High-availability DB, such as Hadoop/Cassandra</li>
<li>Software development philosophy </li>
<li>More advanced algorithm</li>
<li>Useful skills (unit testing...)</li>
</ul>

<p>etc...</p>

<p>OK, I'm not asking you which one I should choose and learn, but I believe that as a programmer, you would like to learn a lot of things, too. How did determine which one was important to you and how deep you should learn it? How did you determine which to learn first, which to learn deeper?...</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I recommend the following:</p>

<pre><code>[[NSThread currentThread] setName:@"My thread name"]; // For Cocoa  
pthread_setname_np("My thread name"); // For GDB.

<p>(You'll need to include pthread.h)

<p>I'm trying to put the Facebook Like button using xfbml in my Blogger blog. I want it to display a different button for each post, not the same for all the blog.</p>

<p>I've followed the guidelines in this link, among others: <a href="http://hitech-tips.blogspot.com/2010/05/facebook-like-button-xfbml-tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">http://hitech-tips.blogspot.com/2010/05/facebook-like-button-xfbml-tutorial.html</a></p>

<p>What's happening is that the like button is displayed, but it's exactly the same one for all the posts. I've read that using expr:href='data:post.url' should fix this particular problem, but for some reason this is not working.

  <p>What is the reason behind this?. </p>

<p>I cannot think of any technical reason why you would do this, but maybe it is done to make the class / interface relationships more explicit in the source code and Javadoc.</p>

<p>But whatever the reason, it makes no practical difference.</p>

<p>a xor b?</p>

<p>I can't remember if C++ has an XOR operator now -- I think it's <code>a ^ b</code>.</p>

<p>You can escape the slash. Use <code>\\</code> and you get just one slash.</p>

<p>you can certainly use SSE registers, but compiler may do this for you anyways</p>

<p>There are several ways to do it, I'll just mention one:</p>

<p>SSE4</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>PMINUD</code> and <code>PMAXUD</code> to separate the larger value in register #1, and the smaller value in register #2.</li>
<li>Subtract them.</li>
</ul>

<p>MMX/SSE2</p>

<ul>
<li>Flip the sign bit of the two values because the next instruction only accepts signed integer comparison.</li>
<li><code>PCMPGTD</code>. Use this result as a mask.</li>
<li>Compute the results of both <code>(a-b)</code> and <code>(b-a)</code></li>
<li>Use <code>POR ( PAND ( mask, a-b ), PANDN ( mask, b-a ) )</code> to select the correct value for the absolute difference.</li>
</ul>

<p>Aim for learning at least one language/technology from each major "paradigm". As for what you decide to learn when, just go with whatever is most applicable to things you're actually trying to do. If nothing is applicable, go with whatever you find yourself thinking about the most.</p>

<p>Becoming a great programmer is a multiple-decade process. Becoming a competent programmer is an at-least-a-few-years process.</p>

<p>I aim for a new paradigm, or technology in an area I'm not very familiar with at least once a year. This is enough time to get more than a "tutorial-level" overview of the topic, allowing my newly gained knowledge to assist me when using other, more familiar, technologies. Sometimes the new stuff becomes the normal stuff as well.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to determine what to learn first by dipping your fingers in everything until you see what coats your hands and what runs off. Being a "greedy programmer" is not necessarily bad. Just don't be a greedy <em>and impatient</em> programmer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>What are the tricks and tips one should follow to search in google for exactly getting the relevant search. I have heard and used about google hacks but still having a lot of problem in searching the relevant data on google or any other search engine.</p>

<p>Make sure you embed the font and that it is tracing out what the textfield is saying.</p>

<p>I wouldn't necessarily say that UTF-16 is harmful.  It's not elegant, but it serves its purpose of backwards compatibility with UCS-2, just like GB18030 does with GB2312, and UTF-8 does with ASCII.</p>

<p>But making a fundamental change to the structure of Unicode in midstream, after Microsoft and Sun had built huge APIs around 16-bit characters, was harmful.  The failure to spread awareness of the change was <em>more</em> harmful.</p>

<p><code>%$hash_ref = ();</code> makes more sense than undef-ing the hash. Undef-ing the hash says that you're done with the hash. Assigning an empty list says you just want an empty hash. </p>

<p>Try this (assumes 2nd complements, which is OK judgning by the fact that you're asking for SSE):</p>

<pre><code>int d = a-b;
int ad = ((d &gt;&gt; 30) | 1) * d;
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation: sign-bit (bit 31) gets propagated down to 1st bit. the | 1 part ensures that the multiplier is either 1 or -1. Multiplications are fast on modern CPUs.</p>

<p>I'm trying to get into making Facebook apps but I'm having trouble getting authorization working in a redirect scheme inside the canvas.</p>

<p>Using the javascript api, I got it working pretty easily in a popup scheme:</p>

<pre><code>$("#loginButton").click(function(e) {
    FB.login(function(response) {
        if (response.perms) {
            perms();
        }
}, {perms : 'publish_stream'});
</code></pre>

<p>But the popup should be an unnecessary extra click, because every other application I see requests the authorization before even showing you the landing page.  Like this:</p>

<p>i.imgur.com/yBGzL.png</p>

<p>I figure they're simply using a redirect scheme.  So I spent the entire day trying the different ways I could find:</p>

<pre><code>header("Location: https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=" . $gAppId . "&amp;redirect_uri=" . urlencode($gUrl) . "&amp;perms=publish_stream");

header("Location: http://www.facebook.com/login.php?v=1.0&amp;api_key=" . $gApiKey . "&amp;next=" . urlencode($gUrl) . "&amp;canvas=");

header("Location: http://www.facebook.com/connect/uiserver.php?app_id=" . $gAppId . "&amp;next=" . urlencode($gUrl) . "&amp;return_session=0&amp;fbconnect=0&amp;canvas=1&amp;legacy_return=1&amp;method=permissions.request");
</code></pre>

<p>But all of them, instead of showing the authorization request stuff, show a link like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/bLwPQ.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/bLwPQ.png</a></p>

<p>Hilariously, if I open the iframe's address in a new tab, I get the authorization request like I wanted.  But I want it to display immediately, without an extra click, like every other app.</p>

<p>Here's an example of an app that is doing authorization and requesting permissions all in one go, in redirect form, before even displaying the landing page:</p>

<p>www.facebook.com/send.fortune.cookies</p>

<p>How are they doing it?</p>

<p>The Mapper of each mapped entity has an attribute <code>columns</code> with all column definitions. For example, if you have a declarative class <code>User</code> you can access the mapper with <code>User.__mapper__</code> and the columns with:</p>

<p>I'd recommend taking a look at this article:

<p>Particularly, query_reviewer and newrelic have been a life-saver for me.</p>

<p>Here is what was going on in my code. I have a class B which contains a method retuning the fetched result R whose type is NSManagedObject to my current class A. And I assign the R to the the property pR in A. After a while another method in A tried to update the object MO and persistent it in database. However pA became nil at that time. I needed to retain the R when it was assigned to pR. I declared pR to be (nonatomic, retain) and synthesized it. Does the fetched result returned from B will be released automatically? </p>

<p>No worry, you're not working at low enough levels to damage any of your hardware (on any semi-sane operating system, at least -- but I don't know any that's crazy enough to let application SW working at such a reasonable abstraction level to damage a monitor;-).</p>

<p>I would say consider where you want your career path to go as one way to decide. That always helps me decide which languages to focus more of my energy on. I wouldn't let current work loads drive what you focus on. If you did you could end up doing the same thing for 5-10 years and realize that you missed a lot of things that could have contributed a lot to your growth.</p>

<p>Also I always tend to think patterns and disciplines are a much better use of your time than particular languages. Languages come and go. But a good design pattern can live on through nearly any language.</p>

<p>That's my thoughts!</p>

<p>hello friends,
i need to know about boot loader and kernel in deep from its basic.
i search the google and got a lot of links... but i need to find the good ones. if you pals have any docs or video or htmls share with me.....</p>

<p>thanks in advance</p>

<p>hey all,</p>

<p>so i've scrapped all the crappy tutorials that have never worked for one reason or another, and decided to roll out my own registration/login feature on my own, and to my surprise it actually works!</p>

<p>But what i don't get is how the logic behind keeping somebody logged in works! Like, once they've logged in, do i just $_POST their data to whatever other page they visit and once they're on the new page $_REQUEST that post data from the url and display a message like: "yeah, you're still logged in"?</p>

<p>i'm a bit confused atm, so I hope this question doesn't confuse you too.</p>

<p>thank you</p>

<p>What is the story with the VC debug CRT?  where is it supposed to come from?</p>

<p>in particular, on my machine, running both VS2008 and VS2010 I dont have the amd64 version installed in c:\windows\winsxs?  </p>

<p>reading about this on the internet has been very confusing,  I feel that everyone is hacking around, copying bits to C:\windows\system32, etc.</p>

<p>Where am I suppose to be getting the debug CRT and how do I correctly install it?  I see the binaries were copied to C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\redist during the VS install. </p>

<p>now what?</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>

<p>I have a PHP application, which has a delete function on one of the pages. I am allowing user to delete a tag from their profile, by clicking on the tag. Once the user clicks the tag, the content area in the HTML which previous displayed the tags, gets updated with the new set of tags.</p>

<p>Now the problem is, from the list of tags,the first time user clicks a tag, it is deleted.If the user now clicks another tag(from the refreshed area), nothing happens.</p>

<pre><code> $("a.single_tag").click(function(){
   the_id = $(this).attr('id');
     $.ajax({
         type: "POST",
         data: "data="+the_id,
         url: "&lt;?php echo site_url('user/deletetag/');?&gt;/",
         success: function(msg)
         {
           $("#current_tags").fadeIn("slow");
           $("#current_tags").html(msg);

         }
    });  
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I want to style my <code>&lt;BR&gt;</code> elements to have margins more like <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> elements. How can I do that?</p>

<p>To link an executable with a library that resides in a standard location, one can do the following in a CmakeLists.txt file:</p>

<pre><code>create_executable(generate_mesh generate_mesh.cpp)
target_link_libraries(generate_mesh OpenMeshCore)
</code></pre>

<p>This would work if the library, that is being linked against, was placed in </p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/lib/libOpenMeshCore.dylib
</code></pre>

<p>However, in this case the library resides under</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/lib/OpenMesh/libOpenMeshCore.dylib
</code></pre>

<p>How can I specify that target_link_libraries should really link against a library placed in a sibdirectory? I wonder there is some useful option to target_link_libraries that would specify that the library is in a subdirectory in a standandard location, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>target_link_libraries(generate_mesh OpenMesh/OpenMeshCore)
</code></pre>

<p>If that is not possible, is there a way to use find_library to search <code>/usr/local/lib</code> recursively, including its sub-directories, for the given library file? </p>

<p>Once they have logged in you generally have two options. Store their details or an authentication token (something that will help the PHP on the server know who is who) in a <a href="http://au.php.net/manual/en/book.session.php" rel="nofollow">session</a> or store it in a <a href="http://au2.php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php" rel="nofollow">cookie</a>. Both have their perks, but you will need to choose the one that works for you.</p>

<p>If you store data in a session, the user cannot access what you have stored, only your code can. This is helpful if you want to store say, their id or username. You can trust that it would always be their id and username, because they cannot modify it.</p>

<p>With cookies, the user can access and modify them because they are stored on their local machines. Because of this, you need to be a bit more sneaky and hash the users details, then verify who it is with some server-side logic. It's a little more complex.</p>

<p>A session implementation might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>session_start(); //Make sure you call this at the top of EVERY page
if($passwordsMatch){
    $_SESSION['user'] = $_POST['username'];
}
//Now we have access to $_SESSION['user'] on every page.
</code></pre>

<p>On another unrelated page:</p>

<pre><code>session_start();
print "Welcome, ".$_SESSION['user'];
</code></pre>

<p>Perhaps you want <code>SUM</code> instead of <code>COUNT</code>?</p>

<p>If you're returning value 0 or 1 from your <code>IIF</code>, you're actually just counting how many values are being returned, no matter the numeric value within.</p>

<p>Change the Bs and Non-Bs to <code>SUM</code>, and you'll get the results you're looking for.</p>

<p>How about...</p>

<pre><code>def nindex(mystr, substr, n=0, index=0):
    for _ in xrange(n+1):
        index = mystr.index(substr, index) + 1
    return index - 1
</code></pre>

<p>Obs: as <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.index" rel="nofollow"><code>str.index()</code></a> does, <code>nindex()</code> raises <code>ValueError</code> when the substr is not found.</p>

<p>Each time you create a window with <code>glutCreateWindow</code> it returns the window ID of the new window.  You can store this in a variable and use this to access the window later via <code>glutSetWindow</code>.</p>

<p>Also note that you would normally set the display function for a window just after creating it.</p>

<p>Easiest way is to "keep users logged in" is to use PHP sessions. When you run session_start();, PHP sets cookie with SESSION_ID in users browser so it can identify this user. After that, you can set any data in $_SESSION array which will be saved in session between page requests.</p>

<p>You can (maybe in  2009 you couldn't) get the best of both worlds by using the <code>d:DataContext</code> attribute. You don't need any of that <a href="http://silverlightfeeds.com/post/1841/Simple_ViewModel_Locator_for_MVVM_The_Patients_Have_Left_the_Asylum.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>ViewModelLocator</code> craziness</a> if you're not ready for that yet :-)</p>

<p><code>d:DataContext="{d:DesignInstance IsDesignTimeCreatable=True, Type=vm:CustomerInsightViewModel}"</code></p>

<p>In your xaml codebehind :</p>

<pre><code>    public CustomerInsightUserControl()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        if (!DesignerProperties.IsInDesignTool)
        {
            DataContext = new CustomerInsightViewModel();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your ViewModel:</p>

<pre><code>    public CustomerInsightViewModel()
    {
        if (IsInDesignMode)
        {
            // Create design time data
            Customer = new Customer() {
                FirstName=... 
            }
        }
        else {
            // Create datacontext and load customers
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Don't miss the <code>IsDesignTimeCreatable=True</code> or else Blend won't instantiate your class</p>

<p>Like this:</p>

<pre><code>br {
    margin-bottom: 1em;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have been pulling my hair out over the past few days with a div in that does not stretch across the entire width of the screen like it should.  Works fine in Firefox, but in IE (IE8 to be specific) it will not render correctly unless it is in Compatibility Mode.  <strong>If the page renders correctly in Compatibility Mode there has to be some hack or workaround that will also make it render correctly when not in Compatibility Mode.</strong></p>

<p>This also brings up a last resort question for me, <strong>how do I force a page to load in Compatibility Mode without user intervention?</strong></p>

<p><strong>I would like to avoid using Compatibility Mode though because it breaks my JavaScript</strong>, so I will have to modify my JavaScript if Compatibility Mode is used.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>There is no need for separate table for each user. But there could be some kind of optimizations involved with database.</p>

<p>user actually represents row of single table. In relation to user there could be other tables for specific purpose. Suppose "Comments" table contains comments by user, and this table can have multiple comments from user.Then this user table has one to many relationship with comments table.</p>

<p>Some of the optimizations I see here are Creating Views (Materialized Views in certin cases),Column Indexing based on query's used, Even Partitioning of Tables based on Dates/user or some other related criteria to application. </p>

<p>I've never experienced any issues with s3 caching or anything like that.  More than likely, I'd still consider this a local cache issue as the caching could be taking place in multiple places.  To confirm, I'd recommend viewing the actual files in your amazon bucket and seeing what you get after an update (I think amazon has this built into their s3 account site now, otherwise I've had good luck with cloudberry <a href="http://cloudberrylab.com/" rel="nofollow">http://cloudberrylab.com/</a>).  Alternatively, you could just try accessing it from a different computer after you've updated the file.</p>

<p>My problem is something that should be so simple it is mind boggling.  When I change the look (in PhotoShop) of an image file that is being stored in my app bundle.  My method for replacing the old image in the bundle with the new one is this:</p>

<p>1) remove the old image from the app bundle (choosing to also move to trash)
2) drag the new image into my file hierarchy in xcode (choosing to copy to app directory)</p>

<p>when I do this, the app cannot find the image no matter what I do.  The new images have the same name as the old images but none of the image loading methods (imageNamed, imageWithContentsOfFile, nibs) work.  (Although I believe nibs also load with imageNamed, i'm not sure).</p>

<p>Is there something that I am missing here?  I feel like it should be a relatively simple process but I am having all kinds of trouble.  I also make sure to delete the app off of the target device and clean all targets before rebuilding and running after changing the image files just in case.</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The easiest imo is to use a session.
Basically this is PHP automatically setting a cookie (or adding a piece to the url, depending your configuration) on the user system and automatically loading it on each pageview. You can then add data to the session and as long as the cookie didn't expire (or was deleted) and/or you don't destroy the session, you will have that data at your disposal on each pageview the user does.</p>

<p>Take a look here for a small intro to sessions: <a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/php/article.php/3472581/PHP-Tutorial-Sessions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/php/article.php/3472581/PHP-Tutorial-Sessions.htm</a></p>

<p>You can specify any style to almost any element using CSS.</p>

<p>Default margin for P element is 1em 0; So, your CSS code should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>br { 
    margin: 1em 0; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to see default or current style properties for any element, you can use Firefox with Firebug or Chome/Safari/Opera Developer Tools. </p>

<p>Instead of using <a href="http://api.jquery.com/click/" rel="nofollow"><code>.click()</code></a> for this, you want <a href="http://api.jquery.com/live/" rel="nofollow"><code>.live('click', func)</code></a>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$("a.single_tag").live('click', function() {
</code></pre>

<p>When you use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/click/" rel="nofollow"><code>.click()</code></a> you're binding a <code>click</code> handler <em>to those elements</em>, but when the content gets replaced, new elements with no handlers are there.  With <a href="http://api.jquery.com/live/" rel="nofollow"><code>.live()</code></a> it listens for the <code>click</code> event when it bubbles to <code>document</code> and executes...whether the element was there when the page loaded or added later, it won't matter...fixing your issue :)</p>

<p>It is correct. Why didn't you just try it?</p>

<p>Perfectly correct. But if you don't have a very good reason to do it that way, I'd suggest leaving it as a single line that both declares and initializes it. It's more obvious, and you're less likely to ever miss initializing a pointer that way.</p>

<p>You need to throw that chunk of binding code in a function, and call it in the success callback, or only update the HTML of the updated tags (that is, return an id to delete, or a block of html to append, instead of redisplaying the whole block).</p>

<p>When you update the content, the <code>.click</code> binding does not exist on the new <code>a</code> tags.</p>

<p>Edit: @Nick Craver's solution is much better.</p>

<p>Kernel is the core code component of the operating system. It is used to interact with the hardware and provides an interface for application software. Read wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28computing%29" rel="nofollow">here</a> for detailed info.</p>

<p>Details vary from platform to platform, but in general the following steps
represent the boot process. </p>

<ul>
<li>When the computer starts, the BIOS
performs Power-On-Self-Test (POST)
and initial device discovery and
initialization, since the OS’ boot
process may rely on access to disks,
screens, keyboards, etc.</li>
<li>Next, the first sector of the boot
disk, the MBR (Master Boot Record) is
read into a fixed memory location and
executed. This sector contains a
small (512-byte) program that loads a
standalone program called boot from
the boot device, usually an IDE or
SCSI disk.</li>
<li>The boot program first copies itself 
to a fixed high memory address to<br>
free up low memory for the operating 
system. Once moved, boot reads the root
directory of the boot device.</li>
<li><p>To do this, it must understand the
file system and directory format,
which is the case with some
bootloaders such as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/" rel="nofollow">GRUB
BootloaderGRandUnified</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Other popular bootloaders, such as
Intel’s LILO, do not rely on any
specific filesystem. Instead, they
need a block map, and low-level
addresses, which describe physical
sectors, heads, and cylinders, to
find the relevant sectors to be
loaded.</p></li>
<li>Then it reads in the operating system
kernel and jumps to it. At this
point, boot has finished its job and
the kernel is running.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is because new html tags that you just  received from the server, did not have your "delete" function bound to them on click.</p>

<p>I would suggest using the IE Developer Toolbar that comes installed in IE8 by default. It should help you troubleshoot your issue.</p>

<p>Adding this meta tag will also force IE8 to emulate IE7:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I want to implement a network level AdBlock/NoScript-like tool for Chromium, but Chromium Extension API can not do much about controlling raw request data.</p>

<p>So here is the idea:</p>

<ol>
<li>Capture all HTTP queries, and cancel one if URL or MIME matches.</li>
<li>Hand craft packets, like insert a header to an HTTP query.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can this be implemented by running a thirdparty client making <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/inter-process-communication" rel="nofollow">IPC calls</a> to Chromium? A snippet of sample code would be awesome!</p>

<p>(Note: Security is not a problem at the moment coz I only want to try it out for personal interest, not for public distribution. So it may break the sandbox mechanism.)</p>

<p>Microsoft don't want you to put the Debug CRT DLL on end user machines so they don't provide an installer for it.</p>

<p>Quote from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa985618%28VS.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">the VC2005 doc on MSDN</a> Which I assume still applies to 2008 (emphasis is mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Debug versions of an application are
  not redistributable and <strong>none of the
  debug versions of the various Visual
  C++ dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) are
  redistributable</strong>. Debug versions of an
  application and Visual C++ libraries
  can only be deployed to another
  computer internal to your development
  site for the sole purpose of debugging
  and testing your application on a
  computer that does not have Visual C++
  2005 installed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you need to test a debug build of you application on another machines you still can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy the DLL and manifest from <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\redist\Debug_NonRedist</code> into your application directory</li>
<li>Include the Microsoft_VC90_DebugCRT_x86.msm merge module as part of your own installer.</li>
</ul>

<p>MTS' method worked for me. Changing from debug to release fixes this issue. How strange. I can disprove software evolved's theory, as I experience the error inside an instance method.</p>

<p>Here's a <em>memoized</em> version that avoids wasted work as much as possible while maintaining something close [1] to your specs (rather than doing something saner such as looping through 
all hits;-)...:</p>

<p>[1]: just <em>close</em> -- can't have a new <code>.nindex</code> method in strings as you require, of course!-)</p>

<pre><code>def nindex(haystack, needle, nrep=1, _memo={}):
  if nrep &lt; 1:
    raise ValueError('%r &lt; 1' % (nrep,))
  k = needle, haystack
  if k in _memo:
    where = _memo[k]
  else:
    where = _memo[k] = [-1]
  while len(where) &lt;= nrep:
    if where[-1] is None:
      return -1
    w = haystack.find(needle, where[-1] + 1)
    if w &lt; 0:
      where.append(None)
      return -1
    where.append(w)
  return where[nrep]

s = 'abcdefacbdea'
print nindex(s, 'a')
print nindex(s, 'a', 2)
print nindex(s, 'a', 3)
</code></pre>

<p>print 0, then 6, then 11, as requested.</p>

<p>The two queries are equivalent, and should produce identical plans.  It's a misconception that CTEs are compiled only once, providing a performance benefit.  Non-recursive CTEs are just syntactic sugar for derived tables/inline views (IMO mistakenly referred to as subqueries).</p>

<p>Secondly, JOINs vs IN/EXISTS can produce different results.  JOINs risk duplicated data, if there's two or more supporting records.  EXISTS is best used if there are duplicate criteria, because it returns true on the first encounter of the criteria - making it potentially faster than IN or JOIN.  There's no data duplication risk when using EXISTS or IN.</p>

<p>I read a few tutorials on getting memcached set up with Rails (2.3.5), and I'm a bit lost. </p>

<p>Here's what I need to cache:
I have user-specific settings that are stored in the db. The settings are queried in the ApplicationController meaning that a query is running per-request. </p>

<p>I understand that Rails has built-in support for SQL cacheing, however the cacheing only lasts for the duration of an Action. </p>

<p>I want an easy way to persist the settings (which are also ActiveRecord models) for an arbitrary amount of time. Bonus points if I can also easily reset the cache anytime a setting changes.</p>

<p>Well you cannot run an independent java application on Android. Android applications are compiled to dalvik bytecode and really are just written in java but not run on the java vm (Android does not have a java vm). However you can create a jar library that can be consumed by both a desktop and android application and that should provide reuse of platform independent code.</p>

<p>Hi all,
I have a service that starts and binds correctly when it's first called, but successive bindings to that same service fail when called by other activities.</p>

<p>The code:</p>

<pre><code>activity.startService(new Intent().setClass(activity, ServerListenerService.class));        

xmppServiceConnection = new ServiceConnection() {
        public void onServiceDisconnected(ComponentName name) {
            ServerActivityConnection.this.xmppService = null;
        }

        public void onServiceConnected(ComponentName name, IBinder binder) {
            //set everything up
        }
    };

activity.bindService(new Intent().setClass(activity, ServerListenerService.class), xmppServiceConnection, Activity.BIND_AUTO_CREATE);
</code></pre>

<p>The second time around, after the call to <code>activity.bindService</code>, the serviceconnection's <code>onServiceConnected</code> method never gets called. I use a connection class that does the binding, so the method is the same for both activities. The service is also correctly added the manifest file.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Many Thanks</p>

<p>I have been able to change the 'location' of my images with RewriteRule, but I have 3 lines of code to do this because of subdirectories in the image folders</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^images/([^/]+).(jpg|jpeg|bmp|gif|png)$ /includes/images/$1.$2
RewriteRule ^images/([^/]+)/([^/]+).(jpg|jpeg|bmp|gif|png)$ /includes/images/$1/$2.$3
RewriteRule ^images/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/([^/]+).(jpg|jpeg|bmp|gif|png)$ /includes/images/$1/$2/$3.$4
</code></pre>

<p>However, I would like to be able to not need to add to these if I ever add any deeper subdirectories.</p>

<p>I have tried many different approaches to this with no luck, and the following is what I am stuck with atm.</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(images)(/?[^/])+(.jpg|.jpeg|.bmp|.gif|.png)$ /includes/$&amp;
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas on how to get this code to work??</p>

<p>Also, is there any way to view the URL that is being used server-side?</p>

<p>Inside project file:</p>

<pre><code>program Project1;

uses
  Forms,
  Unit1 in 'Unit1.pas' {Form1},
  uSplashScreen in 'uSplashScreen.pas' {frmSplashScreen};

{$R *.res}

begin
  Application.Initialize;
  Application.MainFormOnTaskbar := True;

  frmSplashScreen := TfrmSplashScreen.Create(nil);
  try
    frmSplashScreen.Show;
    // Create your application forms here
    Application.CreateForm(TForm1, Form1);

    while not frmSplashScreen.Completed do
      Application.ProcessMessages;
    frmSplashScreen.Hide;        
  finally
    frmSplashScreen.Free;
  end;

  Application.Run;
end.
</code></pre>

<p>Inside splash screen unit:</p>

<pre><code>unit uSplashScreen;

interface

uses
  Windows, Messages, SysUtils, Variants, Classes, Graphics, Controls, Forms,
  Dialogs, ExtCtrls;

type
  TfrmSplashScreen = class(TForm)
    Timer1: TTimer;
    procedure FormShow(Sender: TObject);
    procedure Timer1Timer(Sender: TObject);
  private
    { Private declarations }
  public
    Completed: Boolean;
  end;

var
  frmSplashScreen: TfrmSplashScreen;

implementation

{$R *.dfm}

procedure TfrmSplashScreen.FormShow(Sender: TObject);
begin
  OnShow := nil;
  Completed := False;
  Timer1.Interval := 3000; // 3s minimum time to show splash screen
  Timer1.Enabled := True;
end;

procedure TfrmSplashScreen.Timer1Timer(Sender: TObject);
begin
  Timer1.Enabled := False;
  Completed := True;
end;

end.
</code></pre>

<p>The splash screen will be visible for minimum time of 3 seconds or more if it will take more time to create all the forms of your application.</p>

<p>Hi there<br>
I do not whether I should ask be asking this question. 
I need to getElementbyid for an object which is already exisiting in the document<br>. In the example, I would like to get the element "test" which is sub of parentDiv1. Could anyone help? It is ok with ff but not with IE. Any tips? </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>&lt;div id="parentDiv1"&gt;
    &lt;ul id="test1"&gt;test&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="parentDiv2"&gt;
    &lt;ul id="test2"&gt;test&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    var prtDiv1 = document.getElementById("parentDiv1");
    var test1 = prtDiv1.getElementById("test1");
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>Yes, they are absolutely identical. Both remove any existing keys and values from the table and sets the hash to the empty list.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/undef.html" rel="nofollow">perldoc -f undef</a>:</p>

  <p>undef EXPR<br>
  undef &nbsp;&nbsp;Undefines the value of EXPR, which must be an lvalue.  Use only

<p>Not having the keys stored in the source code actually is actually bad a practice in the accoding to the most agile setup (<a href="http://www.eishay.com/2010/07/continuous-deployment-at-kaching.html" rel="nofollow">continuous deployment</a>).</p>

<p>But, by what you say, you want to have two groups: those who can make the code, and those who can deploy it. Those who can deploy it have access to the keys, and, in the most secure setting, must NOT use the code of the application. You can make the oauth still work by having those who code autenticate to a system that proxies all the authorization part, and authenticates de application. Such keys (app -> auth middle man) can be in repository, as they are internal.</p>

<p>Any other setup: authentication library created by those who can deploy, encrypted keys, anything else can be broken by those who make the code. If you don't trust them enough to have access to the keys, you probably don't trust them enough not to try to <em>jailbreak</em> the keys.</p>

<p>The resulting deployment scheme is much more complicated, and, therefore much more prone to erros. But it is, otherwise, more secure. You still have to trust someone, like those who install the operating system, the proxy's system middleware, those who maintain the proxy's machine(s), those who can long on it, and so on. If the groupo of people with access to the keys is small enough, and you trust them, then you've gained security. Otherwise, you lost security, ability to respond to change, and wasted a lot of people's time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all authorization schemes require you to trust someone. No way around it. This is valid for any application/framework/authorization scheme, not only sinatra, rails, oauth, java, rsa signatures, elliptic curves, and so on.</p>

<p>I am using R 2.11.1 and XML package 3.1-0, and I was going through an example from <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/R2GoogleMaps/" rel="nofollow">R2GoogleMaps</a> when I encountered a segfault error.</p>

<p>The problem also seems to be doing a <code>saveXML()</code> on the <code>htmlParse()</code> file.</p>

<p>When I was writing up another code that used <code>htmlParse()</code>, I don't recall ever encountering this problem (although I don't remember if I called a <code>htmlParse()</code> object explicitly). So I'm not entirely sure if this is a recent problem or not. The only difference between then and now (that I can remember) is that I've installed many of the <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/" rel="nofollow">OmegaHat packages</a> from source.</p>

<p>I was curious if anyone else was getting this error. To explore if the cause lies with my laptop, I have restarted and upgraded my OS as a basic step. What might be the problem? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I have an array of strings in C and an integer indicating how many strings are in the array.</p>

<pre><code>char *strarray[MAX];  
int strcount;
</code></pre>

<p>In this array, the highest index (where 10 is higher than 0) is the most recent item added and the lowest index is the most distant item added. <b>The order of items within the array matters.</b></p>

<p>I need a quick way to check the array for duplicates, <b>remove all but the highest index duplicate</b>, and collapse the array.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>strarray[0] = "Line 1"; 
strarray[1] = "Line 2"; 
strarray[2] = "Line 3"; 
strarray[3] = "Line 2"; 
strarray[4] = "Line 4";
</code></pre>

<p>would become:</p>

<pre><code>strarray[0] = "Line 1"; 
strarray[1] = "Line 3"; 
strarray[2] = "Line 2"; 
strarray[3] = "Line 4";
</code></pre>

<p>Index 1 of the original array was removed and indexes 2, 3, and 4 slid downwards to fill the gap.</p>

<p>I have one idea of how to do it. It is untested and I am currently attempting to code it but just from my faint understanding, I am sure this is a horrendous algorithm.</p>

<p>The algorithm presented below would be ran every time a new string is added to the strarray.</p>

<p>For the interest of showing that I am trying, I will include my proposed algorithm below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Search entire strarray for match to str</li>
<li>If no match, do nothing</li>
<li>If match found, put str in strarray</li>
<li>Now we have a strarray with a max of 1 duplicate entry</li>
<li>Add highest index strarray string to lowest index of temporary string array</li>
<li>Continue downwards into strarray and check each element</li>
<li>If duplicate found, skip it</li>
<li>If not, add it to the next highest index of the temporary string array</li>
<li>Reverse temporary string array and copy to strarray</li>
</ol>

<p>Once again, this is untested (I am currently implementing it now). I just hope someone out there will have a much better solution.</p>

<p>The order of items is important and the code must utilize the C language (not C++). The lowest index duplicates should be removed and the single highest index kept.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi. I'm a beginner with MyBatis.</p>

<p>I just want to know how to insert a collection of objects from an instance of a class. Say I have a class User related to a Note in one-to-many relationship. I just like to mention that I built my schema using JPA 2 annotations via Hibernate's hbm2ddl. I'll add the key JPA annotations I used in the sample code below.</p>

<p>Here's a sample:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class User {
    ...
    @OneToMany
    @JoinColumn(name="user")
    public List&lt;Note&gt; getNotes() {...}
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, everytime I insert something into User table I have to insert instances into the Note table if the list is not empty. Take note of the @JoinColumn in Note table which should have the id of the inserted User, which I have set to be autogenerated.</p>

<p>Has anyone got something like this working? Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, I'd like to pass some parameters to a stateless session bean. I'd like to do something like I do when I configure a Servlet initial parameters in the web.xml file. Thanks</p>

<p>Pretty broken code you're using there as a starting point (e.g. look at that <code>global rootnode</code> where name <code>rootnode</code> is used <em>nowhere</em> -- clearly half-edited source, and badly at that).</p>

<p>Anyway, what form are you using "client-side" for the <code>POST</code>?  How does it set that <code>upfile</code> field?</p>

<p>Why aren't you using the normal <code>FieldStorage</code> approach, as documented in <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html#using-the-cgi-module" rel="nofollow">Python's docs</a>?  That way, you could use the <code>.file</code> attribute of the appropriate field to get a file-like object to read, or its <code>.value</code> attribute to read it all in memory and get it as a string, plus the <code>.filename</code> attribute of the field to know the uploaded file's name.  More detailed, though concise, docs on <code>FieldStorage</code>, are <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/stdlib/cgi.FieldStorage-class.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: now that the OP has edited the Q to clarify, I see the problem: <code>BaseHTTPServer</code> does <strong>not</strong> set the environment according to the CGI specs, so the <code>cgi</code> module isn't very usable with it.  Unfortunately the only simple approach to environment setting is to steal and hack a big piece of code from <code>CGIHTTPServer.py</code> (wasn't intented for reuse, whence the need for, sigh, copy and paste coding), e.g....:</p>

<pre><code>def populenv(self):
        path = self.path
        dir, rest = '.', 'ciao'

        # find an explicit query string, if present.
        i = rest.rfind('?')
        if i &gt;= 0:
            rest, query = rest[:i], rest[i+1:]
        else:

<p>This could be substantially simplified further, but not without spending some time and energy on that task:-(.</p>

<p>With this <code>populenv</code> function at hand, we can recode:</p>

<pre><code>def do_POST(self):
    populen(self)
    form = cgi.FieldStorage(fp=self.rfile)
    upfilecontent = form['upfile'].value
    if upfilecontent:
        fout = open(os.path.join('tmp', form['upfile'].filename), 'wb')
        fout.write(upfilecontent)
        fout.close()
    self.do_GET()
</code></pre>

<p>...and live happily ever after;-).  (Of course, using any decent WSGI server, or even <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/wsgiref.html#module-wsgiref.simple_server" rel="nofollow">the demo one</a>, would be much easier, but this exercise <em>is</em> instructive about CGI and its internals;-).</p>

<p>i have a bunch of divs that are representing cards in a hand.  depending on how many are drawn, i want to be able to have them start to stack on top of each other so that the hand container div is only one row deep.  the card divs are also set up as draggables so this is kind of me trying to figure out a way to auto sort them.  would using jquerys position setters be the best way to go about this?</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm missing something, but I don't see any reason that you couldn't simply do:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^images/(.+)\.(jpg|jpeg|bmp|gif|png)$ /includes/images/$1.$2
</code></pre>

<p>I am looking for a sample in C to get the result date when input of number of days and a date is given .</p>

<p>inputs are <code>date_t end_date, int days=7</code> is given</p>

<p>I should get a <code>date_t start_date</code> which is 7 days before than <code>end_date</code> value</p>

<p>The problem is that server side redirection is only redirecting your inner app frame instead of redirecting the whole page, and Facebook doesn't like displaying their system dialogs inside frames.</p>

<p>You would need some client side redirection, probably something along those lines:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    &lt;?php 
        if($doRedirect) {
            echo 'top.location="http://redirect_url";';
        }
    ?&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You shouldn't have more than one element with the same id in your document. Use a class. The <em>easiest</em> way for you to do what you want then would be to use <a href="http://jquery.com/" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a> and write <code>$('#parentDiv1 ul.test')</code> to select your element. Other than jQuery, you would need to implement <code>getElementsByClassName</code> in javascript in IE because afaik it still doesn't support it natively.</p>

<p>Edit: Make sure there aren't any "name" attributes that have the same value as the target id, and also that the js variable you're setting has a different name than the target id.</p>

<p>"While there are no limitations on the number of databases or users supported, it is limited to using one processor, 1 GB memory and 4 GB database files (10 GB database files from SQL Server Express 2008 R2)." It is not the size of the database files that is an insue but "1 GB memory". Try spitting the 600MB+ file but putting it in the stream. </p>

<p>You need to bind in Pre_Init.  The problem about loosing the selected value of the checkbox should go away, too.</p>

<p>According to the documentation, the "grammerLocation" property can take two types of values:</p>

<ul>
<li>A resource locator (for resources in jars, classpath)</li>
<li>A URL</li>
</ul>

<p>So on windows, in your case you can do:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;component name="jsgfGrammar" type="edu.cmu.sphinx.jsapi.JSGFGrammar"&gt;
    &lt;property name="dictionary" value="dictionary"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="grammarLocation" value="file:/C:/Users/Pradeep/Documents/NetBeansProjects/FYPApplication11/"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="grammarName" value="word"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="logMath" value="logMath"/&gt;
&lt;/component&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The typical efficient unique function is to: </p>

<ol>
<li>Sort the given array.</li>
<li>Verify that <em>consecutive</em> runs of the same item are setup so that only one remains.</li>
</ol>

<p>I believe you can use <code>qsort</code> in combination with <code>strcmp</code> to accomplish the first part; writing an efficient <code>remove</code> would be all on you though.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't have specific ideas here; this is kind of a grey area for me because I'm usually using C++, where this would be a simple:</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; src;
std::sort(src.begin(), src.end());
src.remove(std::unique(src.begin(), src.end()), src.end);
</code></pre>

<p>I know you can't use C++, but the implementation should essentially be the same.</p>

<p>Because you need to save the original order, you can have something like:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct
{
    int originalPosition;
    char * string;
} tempUniqueEntry;
</code></pre>

<p>Do your first sort with respect to <code>string</code>, remove unique sets of elements on the sorted set, then resort with respect to <code>originalPosition</code>. This way you still get O(n lg n) performance, yet you don't lose the original order.</p>

<p>EDIT2:
Simple C implementation example of <code>std::unique</code>:</p>

<pre><code>tempUniqueEntry* unique ( tempUniqueEntry * first, tempUniqueEntry * last )
{
  tempUniqueEntry *result=first;
  while (++first != last)
  {
    if (strcmp(result-&gt;string,first-&gt;string))
      *(++result)=*first;
  }
  return ++result;
}

<p>Hello,
I was wondering what, if it is possible, is the best way to render a partial using the new razor view engine. I understand this is something that wasn't finished completely by the time</p>

<p>Right now I am using RenderPage to render the user control:</p>

<pre><code>@RenderPage("~/Views/Shared/LocaleUserControl.cshtml",ViewData.Model)
</code></pre>

<p>The page calling RenderPage uses a layout (master) page with three sections defined: TitleContent, HeadContent and Maincontent. When I attempt to render my locale control from this page it appears that these sections are also required - they should only be required in the calling page and are present. I receive the following message, regardless of whether or not I include the sections in my partial view (obviously I dont want to include these sections but it seemed like an interesting debugging point...). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The following sections have been
  defined but have not been rendered on
  the layout page
  '~/Views/Shared/LocaleUserControl.cshtml':
  TitleContent; HeadContent; MainContent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My partial view is as follows (adapted from the following <a href="http://www.schnieds.com/2010/01/aspnet-mvc-locale-user-control.html" rel="nofollow">link</a>):</p>

<pre><code>@inherits System.Web.Mvc.WebViewPage&lt;LocaleBaseModel&gt;
@using System.Web.UI;

&lt;p&gt;
     @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; Model.CountryName)
    &lt;br /&gt;
    @Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; Model.CountryName,null, string.Empty, new { @class = "text", accesskey="u"})
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     @Html.LabelFor(model =&gt; Model.StateProvince)
    &lt;br /&gt;
     @Html.DropDownListFor(model =&gt; Model.StateProvince, null, string.Empty, new { @class = "text", accesskey="t" })
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    $(function () {
        var countries = $("#CountryName");
        var statesprovinces = $("#StateProvince");
        countries.change(function () {
            statesprovinces.find('option').remove();
            var url = '@Url.Action("GetStatesProvinces", "Base")';
            $.getJSON(url, { countryId: countries.val() }, function (data) {
                $(data).each(function () {
                    $("&lt;option value=" + this.ID + "&gt;" + this.Name + "&lt;/option&gt;").appendTo(statesprovinces);
                });
            });
        });
    });

<p>I'd appreciate any feedback or input anyone out there has,
Thanks</p>

<p>In UI Builder the Background color has an "Other" choice.
This brings up a color picker.
The color picker has an opacity setting.
If you set the Opacity of the COLOR to 0 it works, can't speak to performance.</p>

<p>Hello Experts,</p>

<p>I'm just a beginner in development field.Looking for SQL Server books. Please tell me which is good book to study from.
Any suggestion and pointer will be really helpful . thanks </p>

<p>This isn't exactly what you're trying to do, but do you already know about <code>&lt;fb:visible-to-connection&gt;</code>? For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;fb:visible-to-connection&gt;
   &lt;!-- do something --&gt;
&lt;fb:else&gt;
   &lt;!-- do something else --&gt;
&lt;/fb:else&gt;
&lt;/fb:visible-to-connection&gt;

<p>I'm having a little trouble with losing my array order after using unset(). Here's the code first:</p>

<pre><code>$id = $_GET['id'];
for($i = 0; $i &lt; count($my_array); $i++)
{
    if($my_array[$i] == $id)
    {
        unset($my_array[$i]);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Assume that $my_array has 4 items and $my_array[1] is equal to $id. After I unset that I try to run a foreach() on $my_array and I get and Undefined Offset: 1 error. When I run print_r($my_array), I get $my_array[0], $my_array[2], and $my_array[3].</p>

<p>I understand perfectly why that's happening, my question is, is there a way to re-index the array so that item 2 'drops' to item 1, and and the rest of the items respectively to the end of the array?</p>

<p>Something like reindex($my_array) would be sweet. I know I could run another for loop with a new array and transfer them manually, but a one step solution would be awesome. I just couldn't find anything anywhere.</p>

<p>I'm using the minijar-maven-plugin to reduce the size of my jar-with-dependencies jar but I need to specify a mainClass like I can do easily with the maven assembly plugin. How can i specify the mainClass in the manifest while still using the minijar plugin?</p>

<p>My minijar configuration is the default:</p>

<p>Hey guys,  </p>

<p>This website <a href="http://www.annapogossova.com" rel="nofollow">annapogossova.com</a> is set up through wordpress. </p>

<p>As you can see each "gallery" is set up as a page, with an iFrame linking to the actual html gallery. </p>

<p>The problem is - Anna would like to call each item in the drop down menu - Gallery 1, Gallery 2, Gallery 3 etc.. </p>

<p>This would be horrendous to manage as each page would then be called Gallery 1, Gallery 2, Gallery 3 etc..  </p>

<p>What's the best way around this situation? </p>

<p>I'm running wordpress 3 </p>

<p>Do you put your images in a custom sub-folder? If you just drag in images into the Xcode project tree, if you copy them, the images will be copied to the root of the project directory, instead of the "Images" or other folder you might have set up.</p>

<p>Note that you can right-click on the image in your bundle, select "Get Info..." and reset its location, if it has been moved or copied to a folder you didn't expect.</p>

<p>This snippet of jQuery code has served me well when dealing with opacity issues in IE.</p>

<pre><code>    $(function() {
        if (jQuery.browser.msie)
            $('img[src$=.png]').each(function() {
            this.style.filter = "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src="+this.src+",sizingMethod='scale')";
        });
    })

<p>I'm somewhat new to both QT and Windows development in general (I develop on Linux at work and rarely do GUI programming).</p>

<p>Anyway, I downloaded ACE and built it with Visual Studio Express 2008 and have been able to use it in VS programs but I'm having trouble making it play nicely with QTCreator.</p>

<p>My .pro file in QTCreator includes these lines:</p>

<pre><code>INCLUDEPATH += C:\Progra~1\ACE\ACE_wrappers
win32:LIBS += C:\Progra~1\ACE\ACE_wrappers\lib\ACE.lib
</code></pre>

<p>(the file C:\Progra~1\ACE\ACE_wrappers\lib\ACE.lib definitely exists)</p>

<p>When I try to compile it finds the headers just fine but the linker bombs out with a bunch of 'undefined reference' errors like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>debug/main.o:main.cpp:(.rdata$_ZTV18ACE_Reactor_Notify[vtable
  for ACE_Reactor_Notify]+0x10):
  undefined reference to
  `ACE_Event_Handler::get_handle()
  const'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I missing something in my project configuration?  Or did I do something wrong when I built ACE?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any advice.  I'm sure it's a simple misconfiguration.</p>

<p>I'm trying to write a Cairo program to black-fill the entire image and then draw another rectangle inside of it a different color. Eventually, I'm going to make this a program that generates a .png of the current time that looks like a digital clock. For now, this is where I'm getting hung up.</p>

<p>Here's my code:</p>

    /* actual sizes:
     * the pixel value of different sizes
     */
    width = 200.0;
    height = 100.0;

<p>The problem is with this code it draws the rectangle to take up the whole image where from the printf's it should only take up a small part. Does anybody know how I can make this rectangle show up as the correct size?</p>

<p>I can't thank Fuu enough for posting this answer.  I had a very rough time tonight trying to convince Mercurial Eclipse that my repository password had changed.  It seems to ignore .hgrc once it has it's own value in the repository cache.</p>

<p>Using the method described above I was able to remove the repository URL's and that convinced Mercurial Eclipse to look in my .hgrc for the new password.</p>

<p>You can write a method (code for delete operation ) to shift array values around.</p>

<p>like if element at x is deleted method would look like :</p>

<p>But it will be more suitable to use ArrayList rather than array in your case.</p>

<p>Call <a href="http://php.net/array_values" rel="nofollow"><code>array_values</code></a> to reindex the array.</p>

<p>What is a crossdomain cookie ? </p>

<p>what are they meant for ? </p>

<p>Can you give some senarios where crossdomain cookies are useful. Would appreciate for in depth explanation.</p>

<p>You might be interested in the <a href="http://www.google.com/help/cheatsheet.html" rel="nofollow">Google Cheatsheet</a>, which explains some of the advanced syntax supported by Google. The <a href="http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators.html" rel="nofollow">Google Guide</a> contains a more comprehensive list of supported operators.</p>

<p>Can you control the input as it is going into the array? If so, just do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>int addToArray(const char * toadd, char * strarray[], int strcount)
{
    const int toaddlen = strlen(toadd);

    // Add new string to end.
    // Remember to add one for the \0 terminator.
    strarray[strcount] = malloc(sizeof(char) * (toaddlen + 1));
    strncpy(strarray[strcount], toadd, toaddlen + 1);

    // Search for a duplicate.
    // Note that we are cutting the new array short by one.
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; strcount; ++i)
    {
        if (strncmp(strarray[i], toaddlen + 1) == 0)
        {
            // Found duplicate.
            // Remove it and compact.
            // Note use of new array size here.  
            free(strarray[i]);
            for(int k = i + 1; k &lt; strcount + 1; ++k)
                strarray[i] = strarray[k];

            strarray[strcount] = null;
            return strcount;
        }
    }

    // No duplicate found.
    return (strcount + 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can always use the above function looping over the elements of an existing array, building a new array without duplicates.</p>

<p>PS: If you are doing this type of operation a lot, you should move away from an array as your storage structure, and used a linked list instead. They are much more efficient for removing elements from a location other than the end.</p>

<p>I can recall facing a similar problem: that is, how to select a word without selecting any trailing space. I think that code like this C++</p>

<pre><code>textRange-&gt;StartOf(tomWord,tomMove,NULL);
textRange-&gt;MoveEnd(tomWord,1,NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>should give you the right selection, so that you can then test if the caret is in the selection.</p>

<p>I use FireFox as my main browser, especially when testing out my site, <a href="http://www.avoru.com" rel="nofollow">Avoru</a>. However, when checking to see if my code was working properly across other major browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari), I found that none of my custom javascript seemed to work. Although the functions and code were clear in the page source, using typeof returned an 'undefined' value for all my functions.</p>

<p>What is the root of this problem? If it makes any difference, I use both the Prototype and jQuery libraries for my code, as well as load all javascript at the bottom of the page (for speed reasons). Thanks!</p>

<p>I'm at a loss.  I'm using JQuery 1.4.2 and JCrop 0.98.  Everything else works fine, but I cannot move a selection once created.  When I mouse over the selection and click, nothing happens.</p>

<p>I have the JQuery library, the JCrop library and the JCrop css file all included.  It's a pretty clean page without much else on it.  I don't know if I'm accidentally overriding something in my own javascript and css in such a way that it breaks JCrop, there's quite a bit of both.  But Firebugs isn't turning anything up.</p>

<p>The tutorials work fine with my browse and on my server, though they do use a different version of jquery.  However, when I replace the version they originally used with the version I use they continue to work just fine.  So it has to be something to do with my javascript or css.</p>

<p>I'm at a completely loss here, I'm looking at everything I can think of for where an issue might be, but I don't even know where to look.  Has anyone else ever run into this issue before?  What was the problem and how did you solve it?  Where should I look for an error or bad override?</p>

<p>Many thanks!</p>

<p>Have you tried anything yet?..</p>

<p>Just to select the elements and apply a method to the keypress you could do the following:</p>

<pre><code>$(":text[readonly]").keypress(function() { /*do your magic*/ });
</code></pre>

<p>Are you referring to accepting cookies from other sites? These are usually disabled in modern browsers, which only accept cookies from the site whose address is in address bar and not others.</p>

<p>The reason they were banned was they made trivial to track users between collaborating websites, although the advantage provided by this banning is dubious (there are equally effective methods available).</p>

<p>Note that a website can also define a cookie whose scope is larger than the current domain, as long as it doesn't ascend to a top-level domain. For instance <code>meta.stackoverflow.com</code> could define a cookie whose scope included <code>whatever.stackoverflow.com</code> and even <code>stackoverflow.com</code>, but not <code>example.com</code>.</p>

<p>Let us have we have pages like login.php after_login_page1.php after_login_page2.php</p>

<p>You can follow these simple steps</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set $_SESSION['id'] = $userid //userid from db in login.php</p></li>
<li><p>always have session_start() in the successive pages like after_login_page1.php, after_login_page2.php</p></li>
<li><p>Check if(! isset($_SESSION['id'])){
          header("Location: login.php");
     } </p></li>
<li>at the logout.php page give $_SESSION['id']=''; and do a session_destroy()</li>
</ol>

<p>The answer to your question is "no". Usually what these sites do is have one table for users where the key of the table is an integer id field, and the attributes are attributes of the user (e.g. name, screen name, password, etc). In SQLite, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>create table User (id integer, email string);
</code></pre>

<p>Then you have a couple of tables, say, blog_posts and comments. Each of these table contains blog posts and comments from all users. To identify a user, there is a "user_id" field which identifies a row in that table as belonging to a particular user. </p>

<pre><code>create table BlogPosts (id integer, description text, user_id integer);
create table Comments (id integer, description test, blogpost_id integer, user_id integer);
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax is similar for other databases. "user_id" ties a blog post to a user and a comment to  a user. blogpost_id ties a blog post to a user. i.e. You can associate each user with all of his questions and comments. </p>

<p>You can create one table per user, but then you have to have a mapping of which user connects to which database, and you need to always open new connections to databases for each user. </p>

<p>My workplace uses Hudson for its daily builds, with several build slaves (one Linux, one Windows, one Mac) checking out our full codebase from svn and building our app at midnight each day.  This all works fairly well.</p>

<p>There is an occasional problem that happens though... sometimes a developer will be working late, and will check in a change to svn just after midnight.  When this occurs, it's possible that some of the daily build slaves will do their 'svn checkout' before the svn commit is processed, while other build slaves will do it after the commit is processed.  When this happens, we end up with different revisions built on different platforms... e.g. the Mac build might a build of SVN revision 5555, while the Windows build ends up being a build of SVN revision 5556.  That's bad, since we want all of the daily builds for a given day to be based on the same codebase.</p>

<p>I suppose one way to avoid this is to forbid developers to commit to svn between 11:30PM and 12:30AM, but I'd prefer a more elegant solution that doesn't rely on the developers behavior.  Is there one?  In particular, if there is a way to tell hudson to check out the revision of the code that was current at midnight of the current day (e.g. "svn co -r{"the-current-date"}") instead of checking out HEAD, I think that might do the trick.</p>

<p>Is there a common/easy way to handle this problem?</p>

<p>I can't stop the stupid thing from firing off an event when hovering over the children of item.
I only want the event to fire via the <code>div.item</code> element, not the <code>div.itemChild</code>. This is driving me nuts please help.</p>

<p>event.stopPropigation does not work. nor does <code>if(!$(event.source).is('itemChild'))</code>, for some reason <code>is()</code> alway returns false.</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="items"&gt;
    &lt;div class="item"&gt;
        &lt;div class="itemChild"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="itemChild"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>JS</strong></p>

<pre><code>//on hover event for each post
$('div.item', '#items').live('mouseover mouseout', function(event){
    if (event.type == 'mouseover'){
        //fire mouseover handler
    }
    else{
        //fire mouseout handler
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to stop live from firing when hovering the children of <code>div.item</code>?</p>

<p>By the way the children of <code>div.item</code> cover it completely.</p>

<p>Basically I want this to act like .hover() but bind to things loaded via ajax.</p>

<p>You can use <code>line-height</code>. You have to have two <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>, first to break line and second to add range between lines.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I am using cakePHP 1.26.<br/></p>

<p>I got an Input Text box which contains a URL and I want to submit the URL and stored it in the Database using Jquery AJAX.<br/></p>

<p>Here is the HTML part:<br/></p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" id="testing" value="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the JQuery part:<br/></p>

<pre><code>  var whatContent=$("#testing").val();
      var curl="http://localhost:8080/test/grab/"+whatContent;
      $.ajax({
      type: "POST",
      url: curl,   
      success: function(data) {    
      alert(data);}
      });

<p>This is the code for the Action in the Controller:</p>

<pre><code>function grab($w=null){
   if($w!=null){
     return $w;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code worked and I could see the Alert Message pop up, but there was something missing in the message. I mean I supposed to see the whole URL like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But not, I just saw part of it instead:<br/></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com">http://stackoverflow.com</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later I altered the value in the Input Text box like this:

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" id="testing" value="http://stackoverflow.com/faq"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But again, the returned value was still </p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm currently building a website for a company, that will for the moment contain 3-5 static pages (i.e, just content). User registration may be added in time to come.</p>

<p>Now, I've been reading through the Liferay docs, forums and wiki, and I'm still pretty unclear on the approach to take in designing this website.</p>

<p>1) If I were to model my company Website as an organization in Liferay where I would have the public pages of the Website, what would be the purpose of the default guest page? (/web/gues/home)? Do I remove this and redirect the guest to my organization? If so, how do I do this?</p>

<p>2) Who is the creator of an organization in the real world? Is this site administrator? Or the person responsible for adding content? </p>

<p>3) Who is the creator of an organization in Liferay? Is this the administrator to Liferay (i.e the default Test user)? </p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Brian</p>

<p>I have a WxPython app that, among other things, has a integrated file-browser.</p>

<p>I want to be able to create a system-default file context menu (e.g. what you get if you right-click on a file in windows explorer) when a user right clicks on one of the items within my application.</p>

<p>Note: I already know how to create my own context menu (e.g. wx.EVT_LIST_ITEM_RIGHT_CLICK), I want the <em>Windows</em> context menu.</p>

<p>To clarify, I do not want, or need to modify the existing system context menu, I want to be able to <strong>display</strong> it for a specific file within my application. </p>

<p>Basically, I know what was right clicked on, and where the mouse pointer is (if it's needed). I want to create the system context menu there, just like it works in windows explorer.</p>

<p>Hi</p>

<p>I'm very confused with dotnet framework installation. </p>

<p>Even though I've installed the latest version (4.0), some dotnet framework-based programs told me that I need to install version 1.1 or 2.0. </p>

<p>So, I'm curious to know whether I need to install every version of DotNet framework so that every kind of such program can run. Does it cause due to programmer's badly checks?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>It's not binding to the children. It's bubbling up to the parent.</p>

<p>Also, your syntax isn't correct. This:</p>

<pre><code>$("div.item", "div.items")...
</code></pre>

<p>is saying "find me all the divs with class item that are descendants of divs with class of items. But you have no such divs (with class items). You have a div with an ID of items.</p>

<p>Combining all this try:</p>

<pre><code>$("#items div").live("mouseover mouseout", function(event) {
  if ($(event.source).hasClass("itemChild")) {
    return false;
  } else if (event.type == "mouseover") {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Or, alternatively:</p>

<pre><code>$("#items &gt; div.item").live("mouseover mouseout", function(event) {
  if (!($this).is("div.item")) {
    return false;
  }
  ...
});
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, there are many ways to skin this cat but like I said in the first sentence, you have to understand that events bubble up until the handlers stop propagation, either directly (by calling <code>event.stopPropagation()</code> or by returning <code>false</code> from the event handler, which is equivalent to <code>event.stopPropagation(); event.preventDefault();</code>).</p>

<p>Also, if you're doing <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseout</code> you might as well just use the <code>hover()</code> event that does both of those:</p>

<pre><code>$("#items &gt; div.item").live("hover", function(event) {
  // mouseenter
}, function(event) {
  // mouseout
});
</code></pre>

<p>I want to change the values of column <strong>this</strong> in <strong>table_one</strong> where <strong>this</strong> = 1 and <strong>id</strong> value of that row exists anywhere in <strong>table_two</strong>'s column <strong>other_id</strong></p>

<p>So I'm using this query:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE table_one SET this='0' WHERE this='1' AND table_one.id IN (SELECT other_id FROM table_two);
</code></pre>

<p>The query took several hours without yet finishing, so I was wondering if there is a way to accomplish it faster.</p>

<p>Both <strong>table_one.id</strong> and <strong>table_two.other_id</strong> have unique values if that matters.</p>

<p><strong>table_one</strong> has 550k rows</p>

<p><strong>table_two</strong> has 30k rows</p>

<p>I have birth dates on my site in format <code>12.01.1980</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$person_date (string) = Day.Month.Year
</code></pre>

<p>Want to add an oldness of the person. Like "<strong>Currently 30 years</strong>" (2010 - 1980 = 30 years).</p>

<p>But makin the function just on years can't give the perfect result:</p>

<p>If person birth date is <code>12.12.1980</code> and current date is <code>01.01.2010</code> the person doesn't have 30 years old. It's a 29 years and one month.</p>

<p>There must be a calculation on targeting <strong>both year, month and day</strong> of birth with comparison of current date:</p>

<p>0) Parse the dates.</p>

<pre><code>Birth date (Day.Month.Year):
Day = $birth_day;
Month = $birth_month;
Year = $birth_year;

Current date (Day.Month.Year):
Day = $current_day;
Month = $current_month;
Year = $current_year;
</code></pre>

<p>1) year comparison, 2010 - 1980 = write "30" (let it be <code>$total_year</code> variable)</p>

<p>2) compare the months, if (birth date month is bigger > than current month (like 12 in birth and 01 current)) { do minus one year from <code>$total_year</code> variable (30 - 1 = 29) }. If do minus happened, finish the calculations at this point. Else go the next (3 step).</p>

<p>3) <code>else if (birth month &lt; current month) { $total_year = $total_year (30); }</code></p>

<p>4) <code>else if (birth month = current month) { $total_year = $total_year (30); }</code></p>

<p>and check the day (in this step):</p>

<pre><code> if(birth day = current day) { $total_year = $total_year; }
 else if (birth day &gt; current day) { $total_year = $total_year -1; }

<p>I should have looked at the API more carefully. I needed to do cairo_fill() instead of cairo_fill_preserve(). Apparently, the first call to cairo_fill_preserve() was keeping the original rectangle and always filling that one.</p>

<p>It really depends on what version of the framework that the application was designed to run on, there are a few versions of the framework and a few of the runtime.  Sometimes an application can be written for .NET 3.5 but has references to libraries that were written against .NET 1.1 in which case you would need both installed.</p>

<p>There is a fair breakdown of the Framework, Runtime and Language reference <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/688441/c-version-and-net-framework-version/688444#688444">In this Answer</a>.</p>

<p>After competing in and following this year's <a href="http://code.google.com/codejam/contests.html" rel="nofollow">Google Code Jam</a>  competition, I couldn't help but notice the incredible number of [successful] contestants that used C/C++ and Java. The distribution of languages used throughout the competition can be seen <a href="http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/languages/6" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>After programming in C/C++ for several years, I recently fell in love with Python for its readable/straightforward nature. More recently, I learned functional languages like OCaml, Scheme, and even logic languages like Prolog. These languages certainly have their merits and, in my opinion, can be applied more easily than C++ and Java for certain situations. For example, Scheme's use of call/cc simplifies backtracking (a tool required to answer several problems) and Prolog's logic specification, although inefficient due to its brute-force nature, can drastically simplify (and even automatically solve) certain problems that are difficult to wrap one's brain around.</p>

<p>It is clear that a competition contestant should use the tools that are best suited for the challenge. Even x86 assembly is Turing complete - that doesn't justify solving problems with it. In this case, <strong>why are the contestants that use less common languages like Scheme/Lisp, Prolog, and even Python significantly less successful than contestants that use C/C++ and Java?</strong> Worded differently, <strong>why don't successful contestants use languages that, although may be less mainstream, are arguably better tools for the job?</strong></p>

<p>There are several motivations for my question. Most importantly, I would like to become a better programmer - both in the practical aspect and the competition aspect. After being introduced to such beautiful paradigms like functional and logic programming, it is discouraging to see so many people discard them in favor of C/C++ and Java. It even makes me question my admiration for said paradigms, worrying that I cannot be successful as a Lisp/Scheme/Prolog programmer in a programming competition.</p>

<p>Are you using the format:</p>

<pre><code>self.pR = R;
</code></pre>

<p>if you only say pR = R;, R will not be retained as you are not accessing the synthesized method.</p>

<p>If you have python win32 installed, then look under the directory <code>&lt;PYTHON&gt;/lib/site-packages/win32comext/shell/demos/servers</code>.  This contains a file <code>context_menu.py</code> which has sample code for creating a shell extension.</p>

<p>Update: I think you want the <code>folder_view.py</code> sample.</p>

<p>Yes, it's always better to be as explicit as possible while writing production code. Eventhough technically it would not a difference to mention "implements Readable" but it might just help some lonely developer maintaing code at some unearthly hour one fine night. Instead of having him to understand where the methods got implemented from, by looking at AbstractInstant class in your example.</p>

<p>Ah..I figure out it's that I have multiple entries under Targets/Compiled Sources. I removed them and the problem is solved. The multiple entry thing probably has to do with Git merge.</p>

<p>Has anyone ran into an issue with overriding onKeydown where the system kind of freezes for a second? I ran into this with a custom surfaceView, so I did a small test. I created a super simple activity with a counter that just updates a textview:</p>

<pre><code>int count = 0;

@Override
public void onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
    count++;
    // Output count to a textview control. 
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you try that out, and hold any key, you'll see the textview update, then nothing for a second, and it'll catch back up. </p>

<p>Thanks for any input. </p>

<p>Don't use jQuery to add styles to your HTML. You should generate proper HTML and then use CSS styling.</p>

<hr>

<p>But if you still want to do this:</p>

<pre><code>$("p").html( $("p").text().replace(/word/, "&lt;span class='my-word'&gt;word&lt;/span&gt;") );
</code></pre>

<p>And in CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.my-word { color: red; }

<p>how create makefiles in c++ and why it is used?</p>

<p>I don't quite understand your proposed algorithm (I don't understand what it means to add a string to an index in step 5), but what I would do is:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned int i;
for (i = n; i &gt; 0; i--)
{
    unsigned int j;

    if (strarray[i - 1] == NULL)
    {
        continue;
    }

    for (j = i - 1; j &gt; 0; j--)
    {
        if (strcmp(strarray[i - 1], strarray[j - 1]) == 0)
        {
            strarray[j - 1] = NULL;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you just need to filter the null pointers out of your array (which I'll leave as an exercise).</p>

<p>A different approach would be to iterate backwards over the array and to insert each item into a (balanced) binary search tree as you go.  If the item is already in the binary search tree, flag the array item (such as setting the array element to <code>NULL</code>) and move on.  When you've processed the entire array, filter out the flagged elements as before.  This would have slightly more overhead and would consume more space, but its running time would be O(n log n) instead of O(n^2).</p>

<p>You create a makefile to automate the compile and link process of your application.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.opussoftware.com/tutorial/TutMakefile.htm" rel="nofollow">This</a> link explains how to do it.</p>

<p>I were like you. Although Ruby is popular, they are very bad and inconsistent in such kinds of various versions. Firstly, I thought that the latest version is always the best, which holds the true for most languages. Later, in these days, due to the removal, re-structure and redesign of logic and underlying codes, the latest version is not always good for programmers who are used to writing codes in older version. See  python case (2.x vs 3.x).
So, for ruby, if you're holding a book that teaches you in ruby 1.8.x, then just relax and adhere to 1.8.x. Install 1.8.x version and Practice. Same for 1.9.x and other versions. Or else you'll end up with frustration like "why doesn't my code run?". </p>

<p>The most important thing is RubyGem. RubyGem is also stick to ruby version. Gems that run in 1.8.x are not usually compatible with 1.9.x. So, keep that in mind. Or else you're unhappy that you install this gem and you can't  call it - its objects. </p>

<p>Now, my practice is that I install every version. I exclude ruby path and its lib in PATH variable. When I want to switch between each version, I use BAT/bash file that set variable for each version like PATH=$PATH:/opt/ruby18 . </p>

<p>I've also asked many  questions about this in many forums. As you know, the life and true aspect of programming is to (re)use libraries and objects. If certain libraries don't work with a certain version of ruby, then you have to switch to others. This is also my bad feeling about ruby. They really should have backward compatibility. </p>

<p>Maybe others can solve this problem smarter than me. But it really messed up with my programming life. </p>

<p>As I understand it, .NET 3.5 includes versions 2.0 and 3.0 as it builds upon them. However, .NET 4.0 has no dependencies on previous versions and therefore they were removed in order to reduce the installation size, which was a common deployment complaint.</p>

<p>If the version of the .NET Framework that the program was built against is not present on the computer, and it doesn't specify any supported versions in a configuration file, then the latest version of the .NET Framework will attempt to run it.</p>

<p>Possibly when you drill into the jQuery libraries, you'll find that there are browser specific implementations for its classes and methods. I noticed this with its AjaxManager.</p>

<p>There are a large number of projects with major release milestones just around the corner. These include Ruby 1.9.2 (the 2nd RC is already out), Rails 3.0 (the RC is already out), and a number of other libraries and plugins. Please note that Rails 3 does not support Ruby 1.9.1, although it does support 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.</p>

<p>I would start out with Ruby 1.9.2-rc2 and Rails 3.0.0.rc. These are what will be the current version over the next few years, starting within the next few weeks. Previous versions of Ruby and Rails will be legacy.</p>

<p>Look for new editions of books coming out, having been updated for Ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3.0.</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="http://docs.php.net/class.datetime" rel="nofollow">DateTime class</a> and its <a href="http://docs.php.net/datetime.diff" rel="nofollow">diff()</a> method.</p>

$today = new DateTime('2010-08-01 00:00:00'); // for testing purposes

$diff = $today-&gt;diff($bday);

printf('%d years, %d month, %d days', $diff-&gt;y, $diff-&gt;m, $diff-&gt;d);

<p>Take your pick, the Rails book or the version that you specifically need to learn.
Once you decide on a book, install the versions of the language / gems as mentioned in the book. e.g. Rails 1.2 and Rails 2.0 had pretty big differences and the tutorials wouldn't work.<br>
If you're learning Rails, pick a well known book, install the specific gems. Once you're done with the book, you'd be in a better position to look at the differences and migrate to higher versions with less hassle.</p>

<pre><code>gem list rails --remote

gem install [gemname] --version [version]

<p>VolkerK's answer is the only practice. You'll never need to parse date from strings or string to data conversion. Adhere to calling new DateTime object. Please keep PHP Manual with you. It's really like a tutorial rather than tedious language internal.</p>

<p>I think the version with the CountDownLatch is probably the best solution. "Java Concurrency in Practice" (Brian Goetz) actually talks about this (I think he calls it the value latch). It's essentially a one-time synchronization mechanism on a value being set.</p>

<p>Although it is possible to implement such a value latch with the wait()-notifyAll() mechanism, using the CountDownLatch yields a simpler implementation.</p>

<p>The CountDownLatch await()-countDown() methods provide a proper happens-before relationship.</p>

<p>Hi all, </p>

<p>Which is better practice?  </p>

<pre><code>.listing { some attributes:some values;}
</code></pre>

<p>applied to multiple locations (e.g. search results, category listing)</p>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>.search-list,
.category-list,
.other-list { some attributes:some values;}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me that the second option provides 
more flexibility for future changes to style without changing (x)html and also easier maintenance due to knowing exactly where the rules are applied, but needs more bandwidth to download and browser processing power to parse.  </p>

<p>Interested in your thoughts.</p>

<p>Thanks,

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I have an xslt script that transforms an xml file to another xml file.
The problem I'm having is that the resulting xml file does not end with a newline like a well behaved linux file.</p>

<p>I'm using <code>&lt;xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes"/&gt;</code> for the code to be nicely idented.</p>

<p>Is there a way to tell xslt that this is Linux mode, and it should add a newline at the end of the output?</p>

<p>Thanks,
Anna</p>

<p>So the problem was actually in the fact that I wasn't specifying the <code>:require =&gt; 'aws/s3'</code> after declaring the gem in the Gemfile. It's working fine now. Strange though is that now I've switched to the right_aws gem and the problem (which used to affect that gem as well) seems to have gone away even though you don't have to specify the :require with right_aws. Anyone have ideas on that?</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb822049.aspx" rel="nofollow">page on the MSDN</a> that describes the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb822049.aspx" rel="nofollow">.NET Framework Versions and Dependencies</a> that would probably be of interest.</p>

<p>I'm using Apache, Python (fastcgi), mod_rewrite.</p>

<p>I want </p>

<pre><code>http://foo/bar
</code></pre>

<p>to redirect internally to</p>

<pre><code>http://main.py?q=foo/bar
</code></pre>

<p>Now my .htacess file contains</p>

<pre><code>Options +ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .py
DirectoryIndex main.py

RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f 
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d 
RewriteRule (.*) main.py?q=$1
</code></pre>

<p>Normally works fine. Redirects to main.py with the query-string q=foo/bar
But if I have a script named foo.py it instead directs to foo.py instead of main.py.</p>

<p>I tried removing the RewriteConds and have the RewriteRule alone as a catch-all. </p>

<p>Then it always redirects to main.py ok, but the query-string passed to my script is q=main.py where it should be q=foo/bar</p>

<p>Now there's various kludges I could try involving restructuring my code, file layout etc, but I'd like figure out what's going on before it causes more problems down the track.</p>

<p>So I want to either a) stop it thinking that foo means foo.py or b) make it skip the existing file checks completely and pass on the correct query-string.</p>

<p>If I understand your question correctly, the sample below will do it.  Since <em>Any</em> takes a delegate you can define an arbitrary matching comparison between the two elements of the list.  If you need all elements to match, use <em>All</em> in place of <em>Any</em>.</p>

<pre><code>[Test]
public void StackOverflow()
{
  var digits = new int[] {1, 2, 4, 9};
  var strings = new string[] {"1", "4", "5", "7"};

  var matches = strings.Where(s =&gt; digits.Any(d =&gt; d.ToString() == s)).ToList();

  // Prints
  // 1
  // 4

  matches.ForEach(x =&gt; System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(x));
}

<p>I've not used Visual Studio with Qt, and I tend to very rarely use QtCreator, but usually these errors mean that moc has failed and you need to re-run qmake. The odd thing is that QtCreator isn't doing this for you. Have you been able to compile any other Qt programs?</p>

<p>Since you're more comfortable with the GNU toolchain, why not try using mingw? <a href="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/DOC_ROOT/ACE/ACE-INSTALL.html#mingw" rel="nofollow">Instructions for ACE</a> are fairly straightforward, <del>and you won't need to compile Qt yourself (which is a huge plus)</del> (Ok, as of Qt 4.6 Nokia are providing pre-built versions for VS 2008).</p>

<p>I faced similar situation. When instrument gathers data, the app seems to hang up. And this is natural. </p>

<p>Take a look to AVFoundation framework , specially to avcapture avsession avinputdevice, etc. You can find some listings in the iPhone dev center forums: search "avcapture"
AVFoundation is the framework you want to use to record, modify raw frames, show them, an offcourse add some overlay</p>

<p>If you want to do only overlay then, UIImagePickerController should b enough.</p>

<p>Yes, this is normal as Instruments is constantly monitoring the app's process, which causes the app to run considerably slower than normal.</p>

<p>I faced with a sample code in Java and it brought me a question.</p>

<p><strong>Java</strong> sample code is:</p>

<pre><code>...
public interface CLibrary extends Library {
    CLibrary INSTANCE = (CLibrary) Native.loadLibrary((Platform.isWindows() ? "msvcrt" : "c"), CLibrary.class);
    void printf(String format, Object... args);
}

public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    CLibrary.INSTANCE.printf("Hello, World\n");
}
</code></pre>

<p>But in <strong>C#</strong> we cannot write like that:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IMyInterface {
    static readonly int staticInt = 5;                          // compile error
    static readonly SomeClass staticInstance = new SomeClass(); // compile error
}
</code></pre>

<p>What is the difference between these two languages/frameworks?</p>

<p>What design policy permit java to have const fields in an interface or what prevents .NET from having that?</p>

<p>Its Legal to do it, But there shouldn't be any difference. 
I don't even see any reason to do it.</p>

<p>A Makefile is a file with a batch of commands used to compile and link (yes, you can use it for other purposes outside of compilation), especially used where there are special compiler options required, or where a program requires the compilation of many files (sometimes thousands), where manual compilation is difficult. In the latter case, the Makefiles themselves are usually computer-generated.</p>

<p>Makefiles are usually called "Makefile" as that is one of the three names that <code>make</code> searches for. If you use another name, you will have to specify it manually to <code>make</code> or compilation will not occur.</p>

<p>Makefiles are not specific to C++; they can be used to compile programs in any language.</p>

<p>The basic structure of a Makefile:</p>

<pre>all: makeTarget2
    gcc -o /usr/local/bin/myprogram myprogram.c
makeTarget1:
    something else
    more commands
makeTarget2:
    something else
    more commands</pre>

<p>A Makefile always has the target labelled <code>all</code>, which is run when the user runs <code>make</code> with no make target. Words after the label, on the same line, are other make targets that are run before the body of that label is run (because it is depended on).</p>

<p>Commands follow labels on subsequent lines prefixed using tab characters ("U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION" only - no spaces!).</p>

<p>Other make targets, not called "all", continue in the same way. One will call these make targets, either by running <code>make makeTargetName</code>, or through dependency (e.g. <code>all</code> depends on <code>makeTarget2</code>).</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I'm trying to have different pictures on every one of my pages built on wordpress.</p>

<p>So I have the following in my index.php file, archive.php file, page.php file, etc:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="&lt;?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?&gt;/images/&lt;?php echo $toppic; ?&gt;" alt="page1" id="mainPageImg" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in my page.php file, I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    // TOP PICTURE DEFINITIONS
    if ( is_home() ) {
        $toppic == 'page1.png';
    }
    if ( is_page('articles') ) {
        $toppic == 'page2.png';
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How come this does not work? I tried it with one equal (=) sign...</p>

<p>EDIT: If I define $toppic at the top, for example, in the index.php file as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php $toppic = 'page1.png'; ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then it works. So therefore, it must be something that has to do with the conditional if is_page/is_home statements. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks!

<p>Here's a function which will convert XML name-value pairs and attributes into bash variables. </p>

<p>The use of interfaces to hold constants is usually frowned on these days in Java too. (I'd say that storing <em>non-compile-time-constant</em> fields like your example is even more frowned upon.)</p>

<p>Fundamentally, it's at odd with the idea of an interface: a contract that the implementation will uphold. The implementation isn't going to provide the field, so what's it doing there?</p>

<p>I suspect the C# team decided that it was sufficiently at odds with the concept behind interfaces to not include it in the language. I don't know whether it's just a C# restriction or a CLR restriction too. For example, I know that the CLR allows interfaces to declare nested types, but C# doesn't currently allow this.</p>

<p>Problem solved:</p>

<pre><code>* { margin: 0; padding: 0; position: relative; }
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>position: relative;</code> was overriding JCrop's need for absolute positioning.  Once removed, it worked beautifully.  I'd needed it for other stuff, but I just applied it on a more precise basis. </p>

<p>Took me forever to find it though, had to take both my javascript and css into one of their demo files and check each piece for conflict.  Pain in the butt.  </p>

<p>If you experience a similar problem, check to see if you have a similar conflict of positioning.</p>

<p>Use context, as implemented using child selectors, (modified based on your comment below).  This makes it clear what attributes are part of a general list and what attributes are specific to a search-list.</p>

<pre><code>.list li { default attributes: default values }
#search-list li { attributes specific to search listings: some values; }

with markup

&lt;ul id="search-list" class="list"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;...
</code></pre>

<p>I've recently been working with some top designers.  They talk negatively about markup that has "div-itis" or "class-itis" (they would skip the list class above and style ul).  To counter this, they use ids and native tags like <em>li</em>, <em>h5</em>, etc within.  Since it's a PITA to clear default values, they define only a few defaults and use contextual selectors for the rest.  They use multiple class names when they need them.  They also tend to use compass or less because these environments allow contextual selectors and mix-ins.</p>

<p><a href="http://google.com/codesearch" rel="nofollow">Google Code Search</a> is an helpful tool for programmers</p>

<p>I'm guessing from the diagrams that you are aligned to a * Unified Process approach.</p>

<p>IMHO:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Case - definitely - eliciting business and system level requirements is implementation agnostic</li>
<li>System Architecture - definitely - layers, processes, network, db and modules / packages.</li>
<li>Activity Diagrams - definitely - use this to describe process flows for key processes</li>
<li>State Diagrams - applicable, although usually associated with the state and lifespan of a single object instance, but it is still conceptually useful if you are maintaining state through other means</li>
<li>Sequence Diagram - applicable, although you will probably need to provide an arbitrary class name to attach your functions (if you are using namespaces, then possibly aggregate to these these instead?)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, you might hit issues if you want to generate and round-trip code from your diagrams e.g. from a CASE tool such as Rational Rose - most will assume an OO implementation language (noting that the three Amigos are strongly associated with OO!)</p>

<p>I guess this begs the question as to why you would need to develop a procedural app using an OO language and document it with OO techniques?</p>

<p>Can anybody tell me why do we need to install a set of classes using a script ?</p>

<p>PHP PEAR Lib is essentially a set of classes, is it fairly good to just copy in the hosting server. </p>

<p>Hello All, this is a very common problem but I still need a specific solution if someone can please provide me with a solution.</p>

<pre><code>JAXB.unmarshal('file', class);
</code></pre>

<p>However because of the namespaces present in the xml file the class object is not getting populated with the inner elements.</p>

<p>The turnaround I found was to create a <code>JAXBContext</code> object create and unmarshaller and then make it namespace aware.</p>

<p>I am inquisitive if there are any other solutions to the same.</p>

<p>i want a regular expression to validate date of the kind "13/08/2010"  how to make it?</p>

<p>Writing</p>

<pre><code>IplImage *image = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>seem to be clearer as it is obvious that a pointer is used.</p>

<p>With</p>

<pre><code>IplImage *image;
image = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>you may have additional lines of code between the first and the second line. The second line (<code>image = 0</code>) appears less clear to me. Maybe renaming the variable to <code>pImage</code> improves readability if you prefer the second option (two liner).</p>

<p>If typeof returned undefined for your functions, chances are there was some parse-time error of the javascript. This means that something that firefox was lenient about accepting in your code, other browsers weren't.</p>

<p>What I'd do is pass the code through <a href="http://www.jslint.com/" rel="nofollow">JSLint</a> to see if there are any errors. I saw several errors in your code, but I'm not sure if it would be the cause of the problem. Once the JSLint errors are fixed, your code will either work directly, or the cause of the error will be obvious.</p>

<p>I have a C++ dll which has a GPC_EPSILON constant defined as such</p>

<pre><code>#define GPC_EPSILON (DBL_EPSILON)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there anyway to expose this <code>GPC_EPSILON</code> to managed dll via interop, so that I can set this value from .Net dll?</p>

<p>Quickest is:</p>

<pre><code>NSString* x = [url valueForQueryParameterKey:@"x"];
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if this is what you are asking for, but you could relative position #some_image to the bottom of the div wrapping the two you have mentioned. Otherwise, just put the text and the image in the same div, like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="some_div"&gt;
     This is some text.
   &lt;img src="some_img.png" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't float the image, then the text should be aligned to the bottom line of the div and, thus, aligned to the bottom of the image.</p>

<p>It is only a tool to help install PEAR classes <em>for all users on the machine</em>.  </p>

<p>If you are only going to use a PEAR class in a single project, you can easily just grab the class from it's download page and bundle it with the app.</p>

<p>Simplified version of my problem:</p>

<p>I have some variable, that contains some xml.
x = "foo</p>

<p>I'd like to generate XML that looks like this:

x &lt;-- contents of x

</p>

<p>So I have an xml builder partial that looks like
xml.map do 
  xml.other_stuff do 
  end
end</p>

<p>how do I insert x in there?</p>

<p>If the question isn't clear just yell at me and I'll retype.  3am does not a pristine query create!</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Constants in <code>#define</code>'s are replaced by the pre-processor before compilation. They are not exposed as variables.</p>

<p>You could add </p>

<pre><code>.elephant-list,
.aardvark-list,
.platypus-list,
</code></pre>

<p>in anticipation of future expansion also, but there comes a point when you cross from flexible to absurd. There is no reason to code special names for classes that you have no reason to expect will need to differ.</p>

<p>Should you find that they need to differ in the future, add them. Also from an aesthetic view having <code>.listing</code> divisions share the same styles is a Good Thing.</p>

<p>fun question, probably should be community wiki.</p>

<p>Look at number of finalists by countries: <a href="http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/regions" rel="nofollow">http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/regions</a>.  notice number of people from East Europe and Russia.  those places have very strong C++ communities, as well as Java, for number of reasons.</p>

<p>look at number languages in qualifiers: <a href="http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/languages/0" rel="nofollow">http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/languages/0</a> and finals: <a href="http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/languages/6" rel="nofollow">http://www.go-hero.net/jam/10/languages/6</a>.  C++ starts out less than half and has 75 percent in finals.  either good programmers prefer C++ or C++ makes the programmers.  Probably by the time you master C++, other things become trivial.</p>

<p>You are free to draw your own conclusions though.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I want to extend the asp.net validators such that I can make one validator dependent on another. The situation I have is that we have to validate a date in a textbox. Normally I would just use a combination of a RequiredFieldValidator (to ensure the date is provided), CompareValidator (to ensure the date is a date) and finally a RangeValidator (to ensure the date is within the required limit).</p>

<p>The problem with this is that the validators do not depend on each other, so as a result the user would see possibly all three messages at once for each validator when really all we want them to see is the most relevant message, i.e. if they entered "abc" in the date text box it would not be appropriate to show them the message saying the date was not in the valid range (even though technically I suppose this is true).</p>

<p>Currently to provide this kind of functionality we use a CustomValidator and just put all three validations within the server validate event handler and change the error message programmatically depending on what validation failed.</p>

<p>I would like to standardize this a bit more as it happens quite a bit in this application, I figure if I can make the validators dependent on each other this will solve the problem and also allow us to make use of the client side validation rather than having to do a postback especially to handle the custom validation.</p>

<p>The idea is that if one validator is dependent on another if that "master" is valid then the depended will perform its normal validation (EvaluateIsValid()) otherwise if the master validator is not valid then the other dependent validators will be valid.</p>

<p>I have come up with the following solution by inheriting from the various validator controls that already have been provided in the framework.</p>

<pre><code>public class RequiredFieldDependentValidator : RequiredFieldValidator
{
    [Description("The validation control to depend on for determining if validation should occur")]
    public string ValidationControlToDependOn
    {
        get
        {
            object obj = ViewState["ValidationControlToDependOn"];
            if (obj != null) return (string) obj;
            return null;
        }
        set
        {
            Control control = FindControl(value);
            if (control is IValidator)
                ViewState["ValidationControlToDependOn"] = value;
            else
                throw new HttpException("ValidationControlToDependOn is not a validation control");
        }
    }

    protected override bool EvaluateIsValid()
    {
        IValidator validationControlToDependOn = FindControl(ValidationControlToDependOn) as IValidator;

        if(validationControlToDependOn != null)
        {
            return !validationControlToDependOn.IsValid || base.EvaluateIsValid();
        }

        return base.EvaluateIsValid();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Currently I have just coded it for the RequiredFieldValidator, ideally I would like to provide this functionality for all of the validators but I cannot see a way to do this without copying the above code into a similar class for each individual type of validator I want to provide this functionality for thus if there are any problems I'm going to have to go back and change this code on each validator type individually.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can "centralise" this code and have it easily used in the validators without having to write the entire validators from scratch just so I can change the class they inherit from further down the line.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>This the last thing I can think of.</p>

<p>I always use the same strategy for this: I never try to "understand" the code base as a whole,  and I usually try to follow the request flow. I read enough of the documentation to determine what is necessary to use the application, and I read <em>that</em> code (Keep all source code loaded in your IDE). </p>

<p>For example, in struts you'll be installing a servlet filter in web.xml. Start reading the filter and follow the path a single request takes through your stack.</p>

<p>Likewise for spring, there are two main entry points, the filter and "getBean", both of which are mentioned real early in the documentation. Read those two. </p>

<p>For both of these cases you'll find one or two classes that represent the "core" of the framework real quickly. Read those really well and let actual use cases &amp; needs drive your further exploration.</p>

<p>Approaching "understanding" of an open source library (or any other code base for that matter) by trying to find all the pieces is usually not a very good way of approaching these things, it will usually just lead nowhere because a lot of these things contain too much code. When following the request flow I find making diagrams can also be quite distracting, it tends to draw attention/focus away from understanding (and since my understanding increases rapidly most of them are out-of-date even before they reach the printer). </p>

<p>I am trying to read all content from a text file. Here is the code which I wrote. </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

#define PAGE_SIZE 1024

static char *readcontent(const char *filename)
{
    char *fcontent = NULL, c;
    int index = 0, pagenum = 1;
    FILE *fp;
    fp = fopen(filename, "r");

    if(fp) {
        while((c = getc(fp)) != EOF) {
            if(!fcontent || index == PAGE_SIZE) {

<p>This is the usage</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char **argv)

    content = readcontent("filename.txt");
    printf("File content : %s\n", content);

<p>Since I am new to C, I wonder whether this code looks perfect? Do you see any problems/improvements? </p>

<p>Compiler used : GCC. But this code is expected to be cross platform. </p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Here is the updated code with <code>fread</code> and <code>ftell</code>.</p>

<pre><code>static char *readcontent(const char *filename)
{
    char *fcontent = NULL;
    int fsize = 0;
    FILE *fp;

    fp = fopen(filename, "r");
    if(fp) {
        fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);
        fsize = ftell(fp);
        rewind(fp);

        fcontent = (char*) malloc(sizeof(char) * fsize);
        fread(fcontent, 1, fsize, fp);

<p>I am wondering what will be the relative complexity of this function? </p>

<p>Usually the reason of that is some problem in DevTools JS code.</p>

<p>It is a chance that problem will be solved by chrome restart.
Such kind of problems can happen when chrome is upgrading at background.</p>

<p>The other reason of that can be some changes which you made in DevTools.js.
Of cause if you have done some changes :)</p>

<p>You can troubleshoot such problem by another instance of DevTools.
As example you can try to load DevTools.html page into Safari, open WebInspector for it and check console messages.</p>

<p>The slug for your Articles page has to be defined as <code>articles</code>. This is set in the edit page interface, see <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Changing_the_URL_.28or_.22Slug.22.29_of_Your_Pages" rel="nofollow">these directions</a>.</p>

<p>In Java, all fields in an interface are implicitly static and final. 
But its considered bad practice. To qoute Joshua Bloch from Effective Java:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The constant interface pattern is a
  poor use of interfaces. That a class
  uses some constants internally is an
  implementation detail. Implementing a
  constant interface causes this
  implementation detail to leak into the
  class's exported API. It is of no
  consequence to the users of a class
  that the class implements a constant
  interface. In fact, it may even
  confuse them. Worse, it represents a
  commitment: if in a future release the
  class is modified so that it no longer
  needs to use the constants, it still
  must implement the interface to ensure
  binary compatibility. If a nonfinal
  class implements a constant interface,
  all of its subclasses will have their
  namespaces polluted by the constants
  in the interface.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As to why it is considered bad practice, I think a class implementing an interface with constant fields is exposing  these in  the interface to outside code which consumes this class which in most cases is not what is required.</p>

<p>Given a void pointer to a "blob" of raw memory, there are two ways of writing something onto it.</p>

<p>The first way is to use placement new. This method has the advantage of calling the ctor automagically when we are dealing with class-types. However, when I deal with non-class types, would it be better to do a cast instead? I imagine it could possibly be faster.</p>

<p>(pLocation is a void pointer to a blob of memory</p>

<pre><code>// ----- Is this better -----
*reinterpret_cast&lt;char*&gt;(pLocation) = pattern;

// ----- Or is this better -----
::new(pLocation) char(pattern);
</code></pre>

<p>If the model <code>has_attached_file :pic</code>, you should be able to just point the <code>pic</code> attribute at some file and all should be dandy.</p>

<p>Meaning something like <code>@attr = { :pic =&gt; File.join(Rails.root, 'spec', 'fixtures', 'file.png') }</code></p>

<p>In OS4 the idea is sold to client is that the app is opened in background, and even if the user is on another app, the app can push data to server on regular basis (which would trigger push notifications btw)
BUT on what i read on the internet is that IOS4 multitasking is a fake one :
- it freezes the app, and doesn't leave it in background
- the developper has to specify the app must work in IOS4 (iOS4 qualification process) to ensure that returning on the app won't start agin from beginning</p>

<p>So can anyone confirm that in iOS4 on iphone 4 the app can push data to server in background process ?</p>

<p>First of all, as you have pointed <code>C++</code> and <code>Java</code> are mainstream languages. These automatically means that people who start doing programming competitions will be introduced to them first - by the way who learns <code>Lisp</code> as a first language:) I also participate regularly in such competitions - I use <code>C++</code> to compete, although my favorite language is <code>Java</code>. It is just I want to practice another language apart from <code>Java</code> - also <code>C++</code> is a little bit less verbose and runs faster which is important for programming competitions.
Now to my point - people become experts first in mainstream languages. To participate in programming competitions you must have quite a good grasp of the language you are using. You don't have time to search on the internet for stupid things - like forgot a construct. It is just that speed is an important factor there. To use <code>Lisp</code> in a competition, you must be fond of it. I don't think there are such many people out there. Correct me if I am wrong. And honestly the pros you have mentioned like simplifies backtracking: In whatever language backtracking is easy - declare a method and just call it again for every possible outcome. It couldn't be simpler.  I haven't felt till now that the language I am using is trying to trip up my feet for programming competitions.</p>

<p>I don't know much about measurement points, but there seems to be a function module to read the documents (MEASUREM_DOCUM_RFC_SINGLE_002) if you know the keys. If there is no RFC module to get a list of $foo according to a set of selection criteria, you could always try RFC_READ_TABLE to get the keys directly from the database table. If you were programming in Java, I'd recommend some wrapper classes I've written - don't know whether a similar thing already exists for C#.</p>

<p>Why we all speak English and not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto" rel="nofollow">Esperanto</a>? Well, it just happened so. Even though English is inconsistent and bloated and Esperanto is intentionally designed as 'better tool'.</p>

<p>Thus, one reason is a tradition. In most schools programming is still taught in C/C++, Java, Pascal or even Basic. And participate in those contests mostly students, which choose language they know better.<br>
Also, you can notice that most algorithmic books feature psedudocode in style of Pascal or Ada, and very very rarely - Lisp. I don't know why, perhaps also a tradition. Or perhaps it's just not so good for the algorithms.</p>

<p>Another reason would be speed. Although it's not a problem for Google Code Jam, in almost all contests 2x speed gap is a difference between 'Accepted' and 'Time Limit' verdicts.<br>
In other words, if optimal algorithm in C++ runs 10 times faster than in Ruby, it may mean that sub-optimal algorithm in C++ will still be faster than a good one in Ruby. And contest authors usually don't want to allow O(n^2) submissions, if O(n*logn) can be achieved.</p>

<p>In my opinion the best solution is socket, but you say that you can't implement the server side for this.</p>

<p>You could also implement it with push notifications. You can receive the push also when your app is running and send all the data you need inside the push. Usually chat messages are short...</p>

<p>If you don't want to mess with push notifications on the server then the only thing left, as long as I know, is the polling.</p>

<p>I would like to build an app which retrieves images from my server.
My problem is that I want it to work in the <strong>background</strong> and only when there is a 'new image' to load.</p>

<p>It seems like what I need is very similar to PUSH notifications: </p>

<ul>
<li>Work in the background</li>
<li>Only when there is 'something new' to load.</li>
</ul>

<p>I guess what I want became possible with the new iOS4.
Please tell me if this is feasible.
Any links for how to even start thinking about it would be great. 
Thanks.</p>

<p>Not sure why boogyman's answer has -2, but that's correct. To do what you're asking, try</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>That will break the line and still give you the margin.</p>

<p>I need a jQuery plugin for uploading video files. it should generate some pictures out of movie as it is uploading ( not after the file uploaded ). Do you know such a plugin? if there is no plugin with this feature, can you suggest me some tutorials or articles about doing such a thing?</p>

<p>Microsoft Detours does not include those files or a "hook engine". I suspect whatever you download is incomplete.</p>

<p>You should try look into the functions <code>fsize</code> (<strong>About fsize, see update below</strong>) and <code>fread</code>. This could be a huge performance improvement.</p>

<p>Use <code>fsize</code> to get the size of the file you are reading. Use this size to do one alloc of memory only. (<strong>About fsize, see update below. The idea of getting the size of the file and doing one alloc is still the same</strong>). </p>

<p>Use <code>fread</code> to do block reading of the file. This is much faster than single charecter reading of the file.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>long size = fsize(fp);
fcontent = malloc(size);
fread(fcontent, 1, size, fp);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Not sure that fsize is cross platform but you can use this method to get the size of the file:</p>

<pre><code>fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END); 
size = ftell(fp);
fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_SET); 
</code></pre>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm looking for a few good tutorials or articles out there that might help me with communicating between different views which I have setup in a TabBarController.</p>

<p>I'd like to know how to properly call upon methods in other views of my TabBarController and then switch to that view.</p>

<p>The other thing I am curious about is how to launch views which are not part of the TabBarController.</p>

<p>I know these are simple questions, but for whatever reason I've been having real difficulty getting these simple tasks accomplished even after reading Apple's documentation.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
David</p>

<p>Your problem is that you are not handling orientation properly, you need to make sure that you override the <code>onSaveInstanceState</code> and <code>onRestoreInstanceState</code> methods in your <code>Activity</code> if you want it to maintain it's state correctly. Have a look at the information in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/151777/how-do-i-save-an-android-applications-state">this answer</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/584779/android-switching-between-landscape-and-portrait-mode-makes-intent-lose-values/584799#584799">this answer</a>.</p>

<p>I have a table for pages with fields <code>slug</code> (string, <strong>not</strong> unique) and <code>updated</code> (datetime). I want to retrieve a list of last updated pages based on the <code>updated</code> field, but I only want one result for every <code>slug</code> (since slugs can be re-used across pages in this case). What to do?</p>

<p>I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `pages`
GROUP BY `slug`
ORDER BY `updated` DESC
</code></pre>

<p>That gives only one result per slug, but not always the last updated one.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a library to help me convert DOC files to PDF using PHP.</p>

<p>Hi Sphynx
thanks for your reply,
i ve tried your method, but its working properly, 
but there may b some problem.</p>

<p>i ve tried using if condition that </p>

<pre><code>If findFormType = findType.contacts Then
            MsgBox("Contacts")
        ElseIf findFormType = findType.users Then
            MsgBox("UserS")
End If
</code></pre>

<p>above code is written in Form.vb. now when i press find either from contacts or users msgbox displays Contacts only not Users. More i am not getting your Set &amp; Get Properties. can u tell me how it works, i ve not used earlier. My full code is as below, written in only form.vb...</p>

<pre><code>Public Enum findType As Integer
    contacts = 0
    users = 1
End Enum

Private findTypeValue As findType
Public Property findFormType() As findType
    Get
        Return findTypeValue
    End Get
    Set(ByVal value As findType)
        findTypeValue = value
    End Set
End Property
</code></pre>

<p>again thanks for your help</p>

<p>Make sure you unbind before you try binding again with the same <code>ServiceConnection</code>.</p>

<p>Also, you typically do not need both <code>startService()</code> and <code>bindService()</code>. You NEVER need both <code>startService()</code> and <code>bindService(..., BIND_AUTO_CREATE)</code>. Unless you have a very specific reason you need to use <code>startService()</code> as well as <code>bindService()</code>, I would only use one.</p>

<p>Variable <code>$name</code> (string) gives something like (possible values):</p>

<pre><code>"Elton John"
"2012"
" George Bush"
" Julia"
"Marry III Great"
</code></pre>

<p>Want to catch the first letter of <code>$name</code> and add it to <code>$letter</code> variable.</p>

<p>It's important how many words (divided with spaces " ") the string has:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If there is just one word, set <code>$letter</code> to the first letter of the first word.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is more than one word, set <code>$letter</code> to the first letter of the second word.</p></li>
<li><p>If <code>$name</code> is empty, set <code>$letter</code> to <code>'undefined'</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Why Java impl choose merge sort over quick sort? and why do they copy the content to an array?</p>

<p>API: "The sorting algorithm is a modified mergesort (in which the merge is omitted if the highest element in the low sublist is less than the lowest element in the high sublist). This algorithm offers guaranteed n log(n) performance. This implementation dumps the specified list into an array, sorts the array, and iterates over the list resetting each element from the corresponding position in the array. This avoids the n2 log(n) performance that would result from attempting to sort a linked list in place."</p>

<p>People often <code>realloc</code> to twice the existing size to get amortized constant time instead of linear. This makes the buffer no more than twice as large, which is usually okay, and you have the option of reallocating back down to the correct size after you're done.</p>

<p>But even better is to <code>stat(2)</code> for the file size and allocate once (with some extra room if the file size is volatile). </p>

<p>Also, why you don't either <code>fgets(3)</code> instead of reading character by character, or, even better, <code>mmap(2)</code> the entire thing (or the relevant chunk if it's too large for memory).</p>

<p>A vital reason might be that every contests don't support languages like python or prolog. Specially <a href="http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/Finals/About.htm#Finals_Environment" rel="nofollow">ACM ICPC World Finals support C/C++ and Java</a>. And <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=help&amp;d2=codingWindow" rel="nofollow">TopCoder also supports only C++, Java, C# and VB</a>. It is natural for the contestants that they will choose one language that is available in every contest. Another reason might be execution speed. And yes, another reason is these are the languages that most of the people learn first.</p>

<p>In My Opinion you cannot find a uploading plugins based on its extension. Like Document uploader, Image uploader, video uploader, game uploader, sql uploader. This is not a genuine question, instead you can a uploader script to upload all these. And what you decide to do, or how you decide to present the uploaded file, its up to you.</p>

<p>Here is a plugin, for all in one purpose</p>

<p>Uploadify</p>

<p><a href="http://www.uploadify.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.uploadify.com/</a></p>

<p>However here are some links which can help</p>

<p>You partial looks much like an editor template so you could include it as such (assuming of course that your partial is placed in the <code>~/views/controllername/EditorTemplates</code> subfolder):</p>

<pre><code>@Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.SomePropertyOfTypeLocaleBaseModel)
</code></pre>

<p>Or if this is not the case simply:</p>

<pre><code>@Html.Partial("nameOfPartial", Model)
</code></pre>

<p>If the XML is using namespaces, those are part of the element name and they should not be parsed as if they were unnamespaced elements. Therefore that is not an option in JAXB. A <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/277502/jaxb-how-to-ignore-namespace-during-unmarshalling-xml-document">previous question</a> along these lines have given the only solution as sanitizing the XML prior to unmarshalling and removing all namespaces, with the JAXB objects bound to unnamespaced names.</p>

<p>You could just do an explode or a preg_split and count the pieces:</p>

<pre><code>$parts = preg_split('/\s/', $subject, -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);
if (count($parts) == 1)
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>An alternative with explode:</p>

<pre><code>$subject = trim(subject);
$parts = explode(' ', $subject);
</code></pre>

<p>This works too if you are certain there are only spaces.</p>

<p>I think it's weird that Java chose to allow this. </p>

<p>An interface is a contract for a Role. That is, it's an spec that all objects must implement in order to be considered as suitable/swappable candidates for that Role. It should contain <em>the messages/methods that the Role responds to and the notifications that it triggers for interested listeners</em>.</p>

<p>Fields are an implementation detail (and your example contains actual implementation dictating the return value for the INSTANCE field too) and do not belong within the contract. If you wanted to map this to C#, you should probably move it to an <strong>abstract base class</strong>, which allows default implementation to be specified in addition to specifying some members that derived classes must also implement.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.getfinch.com/finch/confirmation/" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, when you submit the form the page seems to stay as it is and it just shows a message at the top of the page saying that the message was sent.</p>

<p>The only part I understood was the following code:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(function() {
var returnMessage = ['I got the message! I will get back to you as soon as I can.'];

    jQuery('body').showMessage({

      'thisMessage':  returnMessage,
      'className':  'success',
      'opacity':  95,
      'displayNavigation': false,
      'autoClose':  true,
      'delayTime':  4000

      });
    });
</code></pre>

<p>I know that the code above makes the message appear at the top of the page.</p>

<p>But I can't see how is this Javascript code connected to the form.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain that to me? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Java guys traded the worst-case scenario with the avg case, as you probably know, quick sort might run in O(n^2) in the worst case..</p>

<p>You can read in the API, sorting a linked list in-place is more complex n^2log(n)</p>

<p>Merge sort is stable which the isn't true for the efficient version of quicksort.
(which can be highly important upon sorting objects + many programmers take that as granted when they use Collections.sort())</p>

<p>The documentation gives the answer to both your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This algorithm offers guaranteed n log(n) performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Merge sort doesn't have the pathological cases of quicksort</p>

<p>One further advantage of merge sort over quicksort is that merge sort is stable; quicksort is typically unstable. (Obviously with enough effort you can <em>make</em> it stable, but I believe it's relatively expensive to do so.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This avoids the n<sup>2</sup> log(n) performance
  that would result from attempting to
  sort a linked list in place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Copying into an array first means you're not relying on the complexity of the original collection's access to individual elements. I suppose it <em>could</em> look at whether the list implements <code>RandomAccess</code> and sort in place if so, but <code>RandomAccess</code> was only introduced in 1.4.</p>

<p>You could override the Validate method in you page base. To add the validation dependency information in the page you can implement a not rendered control:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;my:ValidationDependency TargetControl="RegExp1" Dependency="Required1" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This should work for you:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM pages p1
LEFT JOIN pages p2 ON p1.slug = p2.slug AND p1.updated &lt; p2.updated
WHERE p2.updated IS NULL
ORDER BY p1.updated DESC
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/example-maximum-column-group-row.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/example-maximum-column-group-row.html</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Merge sort has guaranteed O(n log n) behaviour. Quick sort has a worst-case performance of O(n^2). So in some cases, merge sort is faster, and it has a better upper bound.</p></li>
<li><p>An in-place sort like quick sort doesn't work on linked lists, as your quote mentions. To work predictably for all types of collections, a copy is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Quick sort by itself is not stable. Stability is sometimes desirable, and something that APIs should offer.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a function for use as an event handler that makes use of <code>this</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function validate() {
  if (this.val() == '') {
    return false;
  }
}

$(':input').change(validate);
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the same function rewritten to take an argument, so that I can call it explicitly:</p>

<pre><code>function validate(field) {
  if ($(field).val() == '') {
    return false;
  }
}

validate($('#customer_name'));
</code></pre>

<p>How can I rewrite my <code>validate</code> function to make it suitable for use as <em>both</em> an event handler, and as a standalone function for me to call?</p>

<p>It looks like the page uses the <a href="http://showmessage.dingobytes.com/" rel="nofollow">showMessage</a> jQuery plugin. This plugin simply displays a message at the top, it has no connection with a form. When you navigate to the link you provided there is no need to submit a form to see the message.</p>

<p>The way it works is that you fill the form at the <a href="http://www.getfinch.com/contact/" rel="nofollow">Contact</a> page and once you submit it you are redirected to the <a href="http://www.getfinch.com/confirmation/" rel="nofollow">Confirmation</a> page which simply contains the notification message at the top.</p>

<p>Big libraries were a selling point for Java in ACM ICPC. It's handy to be able to realize you want some random data structure or algorithm and just pull it out of the standard libraries.</p>

<p>There are various ways to do this. One is to use the second one taking the field as a parameter and set the event handler using a closure:</p>

<pre><code>function validate(field) {
  if ($(field).val() == '') {
    return false;
  }
}

// Use anonymous function to pass "this" to validate.
$(':input').change(function() { validate(this); });

// Unchanged.
validate($('#customer_name'));
</code></pre>

<p>Another way is to use the first form and use <a href="http://www.webreference.com/js/column26/apply.html" rel="nofollow">apply()</a> to call it with an overridden <code>this</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function validate() {
  if ($(this).val() == '') {
    return false;
  }
}

// Unchanged.
$(':input').change(validate);

// Use `$(...)` as "this" when calling validate.
validate.apply($('#customer_name'));
</code></pre>

<p>Great question! As someone who has dabbled in programming contests a bit myself, I may have something to say.</p>

<p>[Let's get the standard disclaimer out of the way: contest programming is only loosely related to "programming in the real world", and while it tests algorithmic and problem-solving skills and the ability to come up with fast bug-free working code under time pressure, it does not necessarily correlate with being able to build large software projects, write maintainable code, etc (beyond the fact that well-structured programs are easier to debug).]</p>

<p>Now for some answers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>C++/Java are more common than other languages in the real world as well, so you'd expect to see a higher proportion anywhere. (But it's even higher in the contest population.)</p></li>
<li><p>Many of these participants are students, or got into contests as students, and C++/Java are more common "first languages" that students learn. (Undergrad students these days may start with Scheme, Haskell, Python, etc., but high-schoolers (often self-taught) less often.) In fact, many of the Eastern European participants still use Pascal, and are more amazing with it than the rest of us will ever be with any language.</p></li>
<li><p>The school- and college-level contests usually use these languages. The International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) allows only C, C++ and Pascal (or maybe it allows Java now; I haven't kept up), and the ACM Intercollegiate Programming Contest (ACM ICPC) allows only C, C++ and Java. TopCoder allows C++, Java, C# and VB (really :p); and recently, Python. So you could say the "contest ecosystem" has more C++/Java programmers in it. Google Code Jam and <a href="http://ipsc.ksp.sk/" rel="nofollow">IPSC</a> are among the few contests that allow code in any language, actually.</p></li>
<li><p>Now the question is, in GCJ where the contestants are free to choose a language, why wouldn't they choose Python or Scheme? The most relevant factor is that these languages are <strong>slow</strong>. Sure, for most real-world programming they are easily fast enough, but for the tight loops that are often involved in getting a program to run under the n-second limit for all test cases, these languages don't cut it for any of the algorithmically more involved problems. (A problem designed to accept O(n log n) solutions but not &Theta;(n<sup>2</sup>) solutions for C/C++ frequently rules out even optimal O(n log n) solutions in slower languages. Even Java used to be given a handicap at USACO; I'm not sure this is still the case.)</p></li>
<li><p>Another factor is the libraries: C++ and Java have better libraries for frequently useful algorithms and data structures (e.g. red-black trees, C++'s next_permutation), while Python's libraries (good enough for the real world) are less useful here, and Prolog and Scheme... I don't know about their libraries. This is a relatively minor factor, because these programmers can write their own code when necessary. :-)</p></li>
<li><p>General-purpose multi-paradigm languages are more useful for just getting things done within the time constraints of the contest, than languages that force a philosophy or way of doing things on you. This is why Prolog will always remain unpopular, for instance. (General philosophy: some languages are "enabling" languages that let you do anything including shooting yourself in the foot, some are "directing" that force you to do things the right way.) This is also why C++ is three times more popular than Java in the general contest participants, and much more popular among the top contestants. Since code doesn't have to be read by anyone else, it's ok and even useful to have loop macros like <code>FOR(i,n)</code> (less code to type, and more importantly less chance of making a bug when in a hurry). Nothing against Java, there are a few top programmers who use Java too. :-)</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, although many of these top programmers may have C++/Java/Pascal as their "first language", they are not good <em>because</em> of their language, so you don't have to despair about that. Many of these same programmers have won contests like the <a href="http://www.icfpcontest.org/" rel="nofollow">ICFP contest</a> even with intentionally using crazy languages like shell scripts, m4 (used in autoconf), and assembly (the team named "You Can't Spell Awesome Without ASM").</p></li>

<p>You might want to consider using a profiler and debugger to understand exact state in which out of memory error occurs.</p>

<p>I use Jprofiler for profiling and Eclipse's Debugger for debugging. Both have sufficient features for their purpose.</p>

<p>I would have also liked to see stack trace of error to identify kind of error and where exactly it starts coming. This is very important information missing from question. </p>

<p>It depends on what background you mean. </p>

<p>If you mean that your application is running and you have some thread to get the image in the background thread, it is possible. </p>

<p>If you mean that your application is suspended and you still want to use PUSH notification and get the image. I am afraid that it is impossible. When your application is in the background, it has very limited amount of time that it can run to finish its current task. When that time is out, your application cannot do anything.</p>

<p>You can receive some push notification and local notification like GPS, server notification when your application is suspended, but you can only receive the server notification and cannot download the new image. Here is the instruction from Apple Dev documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the operating system delivers a
  local or push notification and the
  target application is not running in
  the foreground, it presents the
  notification (alert, icon badge
  number, sound). If there is a
  notification alert and the user taps
  the action button (or moves the action
  slider), the application launches and
  calls the UIApplicationDelegate method
  application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:,
  passing in the local-notification
  object or remote-notification payload.
  If the application is running in the
  foreground when the notification is
  delivered, the
  application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:
  or
  application:didReceiveLocalNotification:
  method of the application delegate is
  invoked.</p>

<p>The solution depends on the compiler and linker which you use. Always is that <strong>not</strong> <code>main</code> is the real entry point of the application. The real entry point makes some initializations and call for example <code>main</code>. If you write programs for Windows using Visual Studio, you can use /ENTRY switch of the linker to overwrite the default entry point <code>mainCRTStartup</code> and call <code>func()</code> instead of <code>main()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#ifdef NDEBUG
void mainCRTStartup()
{
    ExitProcess (func());
}
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>If is a standard practice if you write the most small application. In the case you will receive restrictions in the usage of C-Runtime functions. You should use Windows API function instead of C-Runtime function. For example instead of <code>printf("This is func \n")</code> you should use <code>OutputString(TEXT("This is func \n"))</code> where <code>OutputString</code> are implemented only with respect of <code>WriteFile</code> or <code>WriteConsole</code>:</p>

<pre><code>static HANDLE g_hStdOutput = INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE;
static BOOL g_bConsoleOutput = TRUE;

BOOL InitializeStdOutput()
{
    g_hStdOutput = GetStdHandle (STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);
    if (g_hStdOutput == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
        return FALSE;

    g_bConsoleOutput = (GetFileType (g_hStdOutput) &amp; ~FILE_TYPE_REMOTE) != FILE_TYPE_DISK;
#ifdef UNICODE
    if (!g_bConsoleOutput &amp;&amp; GetFileSize (g_hStdOutput, NULL) == 0) {
        DWORD n;

        WriteFile (g_hStdOutput, "\xFF\xFE", 2, &amp;n, NULL);
    }
#endif

    return TRUE;
}

void Output (LPCTSTR pszString, UINT uStringLength)
{
    DWORD n;

    if (g_bConsoleOutput) {
#ifdef UNICODE
        WriteConsole (g_hStdOutput, pszString, uStringLength, &amp;n, NULL);
#else
        CHAR szOemString[MAX_PATH];
        CharToOem (pszString, szOemString);
        WriteConsole (g_hStdOutput, szOemString, uStringLength, &amp;n, NULL);
#endif
    }
    else
#ifdef UNICODE
        WriteFile (g_hStdOutput, pszString, uStringLength * sizeof (TCHAR), &amp;n, NULL);
#else
    {
        //PSTR pszOemString = _alloca ((uStringLength + sizeof(DWORD)));
        CHAR szOemString[MAX_PATH];
        CharToOem (pszString, szOemString);
        WriteFile (g_hStdOutput, szOemString, uStringLength, &amp;n, NULL);
    }
#endif
}

void OutputString (LPCTSTR pszString)
{
    Output (pszString, lstrlen (pszString));

<p>you can have <code>ValidationControlToDependOn</code> property as of type List and add the validators into the list. So we can assume that the validator added later depends upon the validator added before it.</p>

<p>so your  <code>protected override bool EvaluateIsValid()</code></p>

<p>take a look at <a href="http://www.phplivedocx.org/" rel="nofollow">phplivedocx</a></p>

<p>I have a class that exposes two methods:</p>

<p> - <code>GetObject</code></p>

<p>Gets a single object, or returns null if there are none.</p>

<p> - <code>WaitForObject</code></p>

<p>Gets a single object, or waits until their is one.</p>

<p>An example implementation:</p>

<p>    </p>

<pre><code>    class MyClass
    {
        MyStack stack;
        public object GetObject()
        {
            return stack.Pop();
        }
        public object WaitForObject()
        {
            object returnValue;
            while (returnValue == null)
                returnValue = stack.Pop()
            return returnValue
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>With the assumption that <code>MyStack</code> is thread safe, how can I make <code>MyClass</code> thread safe? I.e.</p>

<p> - <code>GetObject</code> should never block
 - <code>Thread</code> doing <code>WaitForObject</code> should get any new objects added to the stack instead of <code>GetObject</code>.</p>

<p>For bonus points, how can users adding objects to the stack notify any listeners that a new object is available? (eliminating the need for polling)</p>

<p>This is MSSQL - but will return 'ties' if a page is updated 2 or more times at exactly the same datetime.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM pages

(
SELECT Max(Updated)

)
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah, I think that instruments affect your application being monitored. You can/should try in the real Iphone device to see the real performance</p>

<p>Use a fallback to <code>this</code> if <code>field</code> is not given as an argument.</p>

<pre><code>function validate(field) {
    return $(field || this).val() != '';
}

$(':input').change(validate); // using this context
validate($('#someInput'));    // using a parameter
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, I found the answer.</p>

<p>This is what needs to be done. For the articles (blog) page, at the top section you need to place the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php // TOP PICTURE DEFINITION FOR ARTICLES PAGE
        if ( is_home() ) {
            $toppic = 'page1.png';
        }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in your page.php file, you can control the picture at the top for all other pages (except 404, where you'd need to put a is_404() in your 404.php. So this is what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    // TOP PICTURE DEFINITIONS
    if ( is_page('english') ) {
        $toppic = 'page1.png';
    }
    if ( is_page('aboutus') ) {
        $toppic = 'page1.png';
    }
    if ( is_page('newspaper') ) {
        $toppic = 'page1.png';
    }
    else {
        $toppic = 'page1.png';
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, in order to implement this, use the following HTML/php syntax:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="&lt;?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?&gt;/images/&lt;?php echo $toppic ?&gt;" alt="page1" id="mainPageImg" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That's all. Phew. Finally got it to work :) Had to do it for a client, too!</p>

<pre><code>$names = explode(' ', trim($name));
if (empty($names))
    $letters = 'undefined';
else if(count($names)==1)
    $letters = substr($names[0],0,1);
else 
    $letters = substr($names[1],0,1);
</code></pre>

<p>Hi In my ASP.NET MVC project i have following tag in in web.config file</p>

<p><code>&lt;authentication mode="Forms"&gt;
      &lt;forms loginUrl="~/Account/LogOn" timeout="2880"/&gt;
    &lt;/authentication&gt;</code></p>

<p>This causes even the authenticated users but unauthorized resource requested users to redirect to logon page. but i need only to redirect this page if user try to access unauthorized page and not already authenticated(logged on) and redirect to custom page.</p>

<p>Is there easy way to do this without writing custom action filter?</p>

<p>It is probably slower and certainly more complex than:</p>

<pre><code>while((c = getc(fp)) != EOF) {
    putchar(c);
}
</code></pre>

<p>which does the same thing as your code.</p>

<p>If <code>MyStack</code> is guaranteed to be thread safe then <code>MyClass</code> is also thread safe. In the two methods you are using only local variables so the methods are reentrant.</p>

<p>Currently users cannot add objects to the stack because the <code>stack</code> field is not visible outside the class. Also I don't see from your code how do listeners will subscribe to any events so that they are notified if an object is added. So you could have a method allowing to add elements to the stack and an event that will be triggered in this case.</p>

<p>It wont load any version. 'coz for 1.1 you need to install .NET Framework 1.1 otherwise your app wont run</p>

  <p>So the question boils down to: are

  Assuming you are equally confident in

  for all practical purposes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As is usually the case, "it depends on what you're doing" But since you asked, start here:</p>

<p><strong>Toolset diversity</strong></p>

<p>In my point of view, IronPython is essentially the same as C# with a little different syntax -- I know, its a sweeping generalization for two languages with wholly dissimilar type systems, but they're no much else I can say about yet another imperative, OO language. Whether its C#, or Java, or C++, or Python, you solve languages using roughly the same techniques, idioms, strategies, style, etc. If you're  a .NET developer, you've almost certainly worked with C# or VB.NET, and you've already been writing code in an imperative style for as long as you've been using the languages.</p>

<p>The biggest point in favor of F# is simply that it encourages more functional programming styles, downplays abstractions through OO inheritance in favor of function composition, immutability as a default instead of as an after thought, and so on. If you want to write functional code, you need to use a functional language.</p>

<p>Granted, you <em>can</em> write functional style in C# and Python, but functional features are grafted on as an afterthought. Python lacks multiline lambdas, and C# is too verbose and occasionally <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2422520/why-does-my-performance-slow-to-a-crawl-i-move-methods-into-a-base-class">buggy</a> to make use of functional style in the places where you want to use it, C# in particular has a whole <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/512166/c-the-foreach-identifier-and-closures">boatload of gotchas</a> regarding delegates and capturing local variables, both languages lack tail-call optimizations almost everywhere that you'd want to use them, C#'s type inference is a joke compared to F#. I've tried using C# as a functional language with hilariously bad results :)</p>

<p>Now most people might concede that problems make it difficult, but not impossible to program in a functional style using C# or Python. However, in my experience, its not the languages that make it impossible, its the programmers on your team. If you've got 10 or 12 people writing code in an imperative language, you won't be able to enforce a functional style for very long -- the languages don't do anything to discourage imperative style. And since programmers already code in that style, that's what you get. Unless you have some really hardcore and slightly masochistic FP enthusiasts on your team, I don't think could enforce a purely functional programming style in an imperative language for very long.</p>

<p>The best argument in favor of F# isn't necessarily functional programming itself, but really diversity of your toolset. You get a bigger ROI pairing up F# and C# (different programming paradigm and similar type system) than pairing up IronPython and C# (same programming paradigm and different type system).</p>

<p><strong>Case study of my company</strong></p>

<p>Ok, so with that being said, I've been trying to push for F# at my company. I won't go into a huge amount of detail on what we do, but essentially my team guides users through the process of ordering cable and phone services for companies like Time Warner, ComCast, and other cable providers.</p>

<p>Its really a more involved process than it sounds. For a start, there is a complicated rules engine which determines availability of products, dependencies and exclusions between products, etc. We walk the rule engine graph and build a decision tree out of it, then we hand the tree to a client so they can display it to the user and collect user input, client maps GUI back to our decision tree structure, we walk the tree and validate everything against the rules engine, etc.</p>

<p>I'd say 95% of our code is simply navigating, manipulating, and processing tree-like data structures. Right now, everything we write is C# and its kind of a mess. Incidentally, one of F#'s strengths is manipulating ASTs and symbolic processing (see a comparison of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/694651/what-task-is-best-done-in-a-functional-programming-style/694822#694822">C# and F# code for processing ASTs</a>), and its all possible because pattern matching is awesome.</p>

<p>Pattern matching is a real killer feature, its exactly what our C# code needs to clean it up, and that's why we need F#. We don't have any use for IronPython because its no better at symbolic processing than C#.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Functional programming paradigm and pattern matching are two killer features I enjoy with F# everyday. I could go about F#'s <code>async</code> threading model, message passing concurrency primitives, support of monads, novel features like active patterns, and so on, but those are all bullet point comments. For me, its those two killer features that make the case for F# over Python -- at least for my own projects.</p>

<p>To your first question, about the high availability of the subscription DB, you can use a cluster for failover. If the DB is down, then the Bus.Publish will throw an exception, yes. It is recommended to keep the subscription DB separate from your applicative DB to avoid having to bring it down when upgrading your app. This doesn't have to be a separate DB server, a separate DB on the same DB server will be fine.</p>

<p>About moving servers, this is usually managed at a DNS level where for a certain period of time you'll have both running, until communication moves over.</p>

<p>On your third question about distributors - don't share a distributor between different publishers or subscribers.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, it is recommended to not add/remove subscribers when doing these kinds of maintainenance activities. This usually simplifies things quite a bit.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I need some advice on how to use Moq in a unit test to make sure that my class under test is behaving how I want. That is the class under test publishes an Event Aggregator (from Prism) event and I need some way of asserting that this event has been raised in my test.</p>

<p>I don't have a lot of resource at work and am finding it difficult to know how to set this up.</p>

<p>I have :-</p>

<pre><code>public SomeEvent : CompositePresentationEvent&lt;SomeEvent&gt;
{
   EventPayload
}

public SomeClass
{
     void Allocate(){EventAggregator.Publish&lt;SomeEvent&gt;}
}

public SomeService : IService
{
     SomeService(){ EventAggregator.Subscribe&lt;SomeEvent&gt;(DoSomething)}
     void DoSomething(SomeEvent evt){}
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think that if my test is for SomeClass I need to verify that if I call SomeClass.Allocate a SomeEvent message is being published. How is this done?</p>

<p>Do I also need to verify that a mocked SomeService is receiving the SomeEvent? Or is that a seperate unit test that belongs to SomeService unit test and not SomeClass?</p>

<p>In any event, not sure how to set any of this up so any advice would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Polling usually involves some form of sleep - the loop in your example would be a tight loop that would throttle the thead all the time.  Add a <code>Thread.Sleep(100)</code> call, or some other sensible value, to poll over time.</p>

<p>The other way to wait would be to register a callback, or have the stack expose a blocking <code>Pop</code> method, either way, these would be implemented in the <code>Stack</code> class in your example.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Answer:</strong> Your class would need to expose an event, when they add an object to the stack, it would fire this event.</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass 
    { 
        MyStack stack; 
        public object GetObject() 
        { 
            return stack.Pop(); 
        } 
        public object WaitForObject() 
        { 
            object returnValue; 
            while (returnValue == null) 
                returnValue = stack.Pop() 
            return returnValue 
        } 
        public void AddObject(object o)
        {
            stack.Push(o);
            OnObjectAdded();
        }
        public event EventHandler ObjectAdded;

        private void OnObjectAdded()
        {
            if (ObjectAdded != null)
                ObjectAdded(this, EventArgs.Empty);
        }
    } 
</code></pre>

<p>You have to add a <code>[System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Association]</code> attribute. For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
    // [...]

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Association("User_Roles", "UserId", "RoleId")]
    public ICollection&lt;Role&gt; Roles { get; set; }
}

public class Role
{
    // [...]

    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Association("Role_Users", "RoleId", "UserId")]
    public ICollection&lt;User&gt; Users { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the association is intended to be bi-directional, you must add this attribute on <em>both</em> the <code>User.Roles</code> and the <code>Role.Users</code> properties.</p>

<p>system() will return a code indicating what your C program returned or if it was terminated by a signal; assuming the later is not the case, you can do</p>

<pre><code>$exitcode = system('a.out');
print "return code was ", $exitcode &gt;&gt; 8, "\n";
</code></pre>

<p>If you also wish to capture the output, you can use backticks and the code will be in the $? variable.</p>

<pre><code>$output = `a.out`;
$exitcode = $?;
print "return code was ", $exitcode &gt;&gt; 8, "\n";
print "output was:\n", $output;
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to use a module like IPC::Cmd that has several other features you may want.</p>

<p>I had to do exactly the same for one of my sites. You can follow the following steps</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you've cPanel on your server, create a subdomain <code>*</code>, if not, you'd have to set-up an A record in your DNS (for BIND see <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/10/wildcard-dns-and-sub-domains/" rel="nofollow">http://ma.tt/2003/10/wildcard-dns-and-sub-domains/</a>). On your dev. server you'd be far better off faking subdomains by adding each to your <code>hosts</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>(If you used cPanel you won't have to do this). You'll have to add soemthing like the following to your apache vhosts file. It largely depends on what type of server (shared or not) you're running. THE FOLLOWING CODE IS NOT COMPLETE. IT'S JUST TO GIVE DIRECTION. NOTE: <code>ServerAlias example.com *.example.com</code> is important.  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80&gt;  
        DocumentRoot /var/www/  
        ServerName example.com  
        ServerAlias example.com *.example.com  
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Next, since you can use the PHP script to check the "Host" header and find out the subdomain and serve content accordingly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I think the title is self-explanatory. Many times I have small typos and I get unexpected results when trying to access undefined hash keys. I know I can add some <code>defined</code> check before each time I access a hash key, but I wonder if there's any cleaner way to warn against such cases....</p>

<p>I'm trying to set up mongodb on webfaction. It works fine, currently running on port 36505 on the server. I can connect to it on the server just fine. But per the firewall, I can't connect to 36505 on the server from the 'net.</p>

<p>I can expose the port by mapping the port to port 80 under a sub-path. So I can make 1.1.1.1:36505 to 1.1.1.1:80/mongodb</p>

<p>All that this line does in <code>web.config</code> is to simply define the timeout of the authentication cookie and the login url. It is your code that decides which parts of the site are authenticated or no, by for example decorating your controllers and/or actions with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.mvc.authorizeattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>[Authorize]</code></a> attribute.</p>

<p>I followed <a href="http://superfancy.net/coding/php-mysql-apache-in-mac-osx-leopard/" rel="nofollow">this</a> instruction but not worked for me. I just wanna install and config cakephp in my new MacBook Pro and that's why I'm tried to rename my php.ini.default to php.ini. Before that, I had no problem in communicating between my MySQL and Mac pre-installed PHP. </p>

<p>What's wrong with <a href="http://superfancy.net/coding/php-mysql-apache-in-mac-osx-leopard/" rel="nofollow">that</a> instruction. ( specially "Getting MySQL and PHP to communicate" part )</p>

<p>BTW it's not permission problem or mysql.sock location I think. I checked them. </p>

<p>Please help me. 
Thanks</p>

<pre><code>alter table `database`.`table` 
   add column `noOfTry` int(11) DEFAULT '0' NULL after `column`;
</code></pre>

<p>where column is the column before the on you want to add if you want to add in the middle of the table but this is optional.</p>

<p>I think your problem is that all of your methods EventsController are declared to be private. Private methods cannot be called as actions - so you are having problems.</p>

<p>Try to move private declaration and redirect_if_not_logged_in to the end of the file, i.e. after the destroy method.</p>

<p>For more information how public/private/protected work in Ruby read this: <a href="http://www-users.math.umd.edu/~dcarrera/ruby/0.3/chp_04/features.html" rel="nofollow">http://www-users.math.umd.edu/~dcarrera/ruby/0.3/chp_04/features.html</a></p>

<p>The simplest option would be</p>

<pre><code>ALTER TABLE MyTable ADD COLUMN noOfTry INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
</code></pre>

<p>Your problem is probably that the image is not copied to the target. In xcode groups &amp; file pane, fine the node for targets, expand your app target and you'll see Copy Bundle resources expand it and you'll see all the files copied to the default resource bundle when you deploy your app to the sim/device. Only the resources found there will be available to your app. If you don't see your image there you can just drag it there and everything will work. </p>

<p>Now, in order to understand why this might happened we need to look at the different options for adding files to xcode.</p>

<p>When you're adding a file to xcode you are presented with a dialog that includes a few interesting and sometimes overlooked option.</p>

<p>The first - Should the file be copied to the project folder, or should it just point to the file original location. The safest way will be to always copy the files to the project's path. However for images (such in your case) I do it differently. I maintain a separate graphics folder for every app, I save images there (both sources, and final png). When I add an image I do not copy it to the project folder, rather xcode just points to its location. That way I can just edit the image in photoshop, do a rebuild, and the updated image will show up on the phone. Whats important to understand that the directory structure of files you include in the project have almost no meaning, files that appear in the Copy Bundle Resources for the target will always be copied to a single (and flat) bundle/"directory" on the phone. The only exception for this is if you actually add directories to xcode (Personally I recommend against it).</p>

<p>The second option when adding files, is to which targets to add the file. This is the list with checkboxes on the bottom, if when you added the image, your app target wasn't checked the file won't be included in the target Copy bundle resource, and won't be available for the phone.</p>

<p>A few caveats - When using references to files in other location, that location is relative to the project's path, so it's a good idea to keep all the files in directories below the project's root directory. That way you can still copy the entire project to a different location and it will still work.</p>

<p>Use Hash::Util:</p>

<pre><code>use Hash::Util "lock_keys";
my %hash = (foo =&gt; 42, bar =&gt; 23);
lock_keys(%hash);
print $hash{foo};
print $hash{baz};
print $hash{bar};
</code></pre>

<p>output:</p>

<pre><code>42
Attempt to access disallowed key 'baz' in a restricted hash at foo line 5.
</code></pre>

<p>There are other functions that allow specifying which keys to allow, not just defaulting to what's already there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible to make our site's content at least accessible in all conditions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. But the more complicated and feature-rich the site becomes, the harder it gets to make it accessible.</p>

<p>A plain-text site will be accessible to nearly everybody, a website built in Flash only to a smaller group (and less accessible even to that group, but that's a different story).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should we think about all conditions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This depends entirely on your target audience, and the amount of time and money you're willing to invest.</p>

<p>For a government or a health agency, accessibility is very important. For a website with Flash games, probably less so.</p>

<p>You may want to try one of the following two lines:</p>

<pre><code>require_once STYLESHEETPATH . '/wp-load.php';
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>require_once TEMPLATEPATH . '/wp-load.php';
</code></pre>

<p>There is a slight difference between the STYLESHEETPATH constant and the TEMPLATEPATH constant. If you are developing a child theme, STYLESHEETPATH will be the child theme path, while TEMPLATEPATH will be the parent theme path.</p>

<p>On POSIX systems (e.g linux) you could get the same effect with the system call <code>mmap</code> that maps all your file in memory. It has an option to map that file <em>copy on write</em>, so you would overwrite your file if you change the buffer.</p>

<p>This would usually be much more efficient, since you leave as much as you can to the system. No need to do <code>realloc</code> or similar. </p>

<p>In particular, if you are only reading and several processes do that at the same time there would be only one copy in memory for the whole system.</p>

<p>I'm trying to add a system tray icon to my Snow Leopard java application, which seems to work fairly well. Unfortunately, it seems like SWT does not align the systemtray icon with the top menubar, but instead aligns it with where my mouse clicked </p>

<p>(e.g. <a href="http://kobyleha.com/files/azureus_2_250.png" rel="nofollow">http://kobyleha.com/files/azureus_2_250.png</a> instead of <a href="http://kobyleha.com/files/power_250.png" rel="nofollow">http://kobyleha.com/files/power_250.png</a> ... I am borrowing the images since this site describes similar problems) 
It seems to have been a problem with SWT since 3.3. I'm wondering if there are any good workarounds available that someone could share?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I am trying to write a query which will count no of records in all the table of a schema and I am writing the following query.</p>

<pre><code>declare
v_count number(10);
begin
for c1 in (select tname from tab)
loop
execute immediate 'select count(*) into v_count from :a' using c1.tname;
dbms_output.put_line(c1.tname || '--'||v_count);
end loop;
end;
/
</code></pre>

<p>Where am I going wrong here?</p>

<p>This is from a quick reading, so I might have missed a few issues.</p>

<p>First, <code>a = realloc(a, ...);</code> is wrong.  If <code>realloc()</code> fails, it returns <code>NULL</code>, but doesn't free the original memory.  Since you reassign to <code>a</code>, the original memory is lost (i.e., it is a memory leak).  The right way to do this is to do: <code>tmp = realloc(a, ...); if (tmp) a = tmp;</code> etc.</p>

<p>Second, about determining the file size using <code>fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);</code>, note that this may or may not work.  If the file is not random-access (such as <code>stdin</code>), you won't be able to go back to the beginning to read it.  Also, <code>fseek()</code> followed by <code>ftell()</code> may not give a meaningful result for binary files.  And for text files, it may not give you the right number of characters that can be read.  There is some useful information on this topic on <code>comp.lang.c</code> FAQ <a href="http://c-faq.com/osdep/filesize.html" rel="nofollow">question 19.2</a>.</p>

<p>Also, in your original code, you don't set <code>index</code> to 0 when it equals <code>PAGESIZE</code>, so if your file length is greater than <code>2*PAGESIZE</code>, you will overwrite the buffer.</p>

<p>Your <code>freecontent()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>static void freecontent(char *content)
{
    if(content) {
        free(content);
        content = NULL;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>is useless.  It only sets a copy of <code>content</code> to <code>NULL</code>.  It is just like if you wrote a function <code>setzero</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>void setzero(int i) { i = 0; }
</code></pre>

<p>A much better idea is to keep track of memory yourself and not free anything more or less than needed.</p>

<p>You shouldn't cast the return value of <code>malloc()</code> or <code>realloc()</code> in C, since a <code>void *</code> is implicitly converted to any other object pointer type in C.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>I think you can either go with push notifications, or XMPP (Jabber) server. </p>

<p>XMPP will allow your iphone app to receive data even when in the background using the new multitasking features (listening for a socket), and i'm pretty sure you should find ready to use servers for LAMP (or at least open source implementations).</p>

<p>Note that the iOS4 multitasking API doesn't support polling in the background, so your only other option should be push notifications. If you're new to push notifications, you can maybe use a service like <a href="http://urbanairship.com/" rel="nofollow">Urban Airship</a> that might make the process easier.</p>

<pre><code>Advertisements advertisements = NHibernateSession.CreateCriteria(typeof(Advertisements))

                    .Add(Restrictions.Eq(AdvertisementsProperties.Name.ToString(), name))
                    .Add(Restrictions.Eq(AdvertisementsProperties.Description.ToString(), description))
                    //.Add(Restrictions.Eq(AdvertisementsProperties.DepartureDate.ToString(), departureDate))
                    .Add(Restrictions.Eq(AdvertisementsProperties.City.ToString(), city))

                    .UniqueResult&lt;Advertisements&gt;();

<p>but city, area or country can be null. How can i compare null in DB with nhibernate?</p>

<p>I am trying to get mingw gcc to work.</p>

<p>I need it to link with libopengl32.a.</p>

<p>Said file exists in C:/mingw/lib.</p>

<p>I used g++ as follows:</p>

<p>g++ -L"C:/mingw/lib" main.o -o test.exe -llibopengl32.a</p>

<p>It has no trouble finding the includes, it just complains that it can't find the library.</p>

<p>It seems unable to find any other library as well.</p>

<p>Also: I installed all the mingw components manually by downloading them from sourceforge, since using the automatic installer produced a broken installation on my system.</p>

<p>As a generalization: You can use all types except the class diagrams. If you could draw a class diagram, you should ask yourself, why you did not use classes in this case.</p>

<p>For all other diagrams, you can use parts of your app as "actors" or "components". It seems like you have not researched yet what these diagrams are used for and what you express with them. If you do that you should be able to determine which diagram makes sense for you.</p>

<p>Remember that each diagram should have a purpose. If you do it just for the sake of being there, then don't do it.</p>

<p>Thank You</p>

<p>As I'm sitting here modifying <a href="http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php" rel="nofollow">PircBot</a>, I've just noticed that the entire backend was written to support Java <strong>1.1</strong>. It has a custom queue implementation, uses hash tables, custom producer/consumer implementations based on wait() and notify() signaling, etc. Even Commons-lang lacks any support for things that Java 5 brings to the table like generics. You can pull a bunch of other examples of very popular frameworks that try as hard as they can to support 1.1.</p>

<p>My question is why? Why are certain parts of the Java community refusing to support new versions? I go by this theory: Old versions use older versions of frameworks and older JVMs, newer versions use upgraded frameworks and JVMs. You upgrade everything with the software.</p>

<p>Now I can partially understand people still running Java 1.5, but 1.1? If your running anything before that then your obviously not upgrading the JVM because of stupid policies/scared of the unkown, and therefor aren't going to upgrade to newer versions of software. So why are we still supporting them?</p>

<p>On a related note, if you are writing a new framework should you support anything &lt;1.5? Should you try forking existing frameworks, upgrading it to 1.5, then talk to the maintainers about using it?</p>

<p>Much more specific discussions (this is about support in general):

<p>There are a couple of problems in you script:</p>

<p>Upon setting up the <code>choose folder</code> variables you have to put parentheses around <code>choose folder</code> in order to force the Finder to convert the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/applescript/conceptual/applescriptlangguide/reference/ASLR_classes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH1g-SW3" rel="nofollow">alias</a> returned by <code>choose folder</code> to an <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/applescript/conceptual/applescriptlangguide/conceptual/ASLR_fundamentals.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40000983-CH218-SW7" rel="nofollow">object specifier</a>:</p>

<pre><code>set originFolder to folder (choose folder)
</code></pre>

<p>The loop that moves the items will terminate with an index out of bounds error because the number of items in the <code>originFolder</code> changes upon each iteration through the loop, as items are being moved.</p>

<p>A better solution is to first compute the indexes of the files that should be moved and then have the Finder perform the move operation in one step:</p>

<pre><code>tell application "Finder"
    set originFolder to folder (choose folder)
    set destFolder to folder (choose folder)
    set indexes to {}
    repeat with i from 4 to (count of items in originFolder) by 4
        copy i to end of indexes
    end repeat
    move (every item of originFolder whose index is in indexes) to destFolder
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>While casting raw memory into objects might work in practice, officially it invokes undefined behavior and as a result of that, according to the C++ standard, your code might do anything. </p>

<p>Placement new, OTOH, is a technique to invoke a constructor at a particular address, and construction is what officially turns raw memory into valid objects. That's why I would prefer placement new.<br>
Just to make sure, I would also have the destructor for such objects is called. While you say that you only need this for PODs and PODs' destruction is a no-op, many bugs I have seen in my carrier were in code that was written with a set of restrictions in mind, but had later some of the restrictions lifted and suddenly found itself in an environment with which it was unable to cope. </p>

<p>Also note that there might be platforms out there for which not all possible bit patterns a valid values even for a built-in type. Such platforms might also trap access to values of such pattern. For example, it could be that an all-zero bit pattern is not a valid value for a floating type, so even zeroing the memory before-hand could not prevent a hardware exception. </p>

<p>This is how you can get current user:</p>

<p>You need to use <code>-lopengl32</code> without "lib" and ".a"</p>

<p>Hi all,i have a gridview that shows some indicators.one of the numbers is a computed percentage it looks like this "33.33333333333333333333333333333333333333" i tried to set the DataFormatString property of the column to several different formats such as "{0:P}" ,"{0:D}" and "{0:##.##}" but nothing worked for me to show it like that "33.34". Any ideas?</p>

<p>The -l flag automatically adds the lib prefix and the .a extension- you want:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -LC:/mingw/lib main.o -o test.exe -lopengl32
</code></pre>

<p>Note you don't need the quotes around the path either. You could also just specify the whole library name &amp; path:</p>

<p>I believe the primary reason mergesort was chosen is because it is stable.</p>

<p>The n log n worst-case guarantee that others have mentioned is an advantage, but it is likely not the primary reason.  If you look at the <code>Arrays.sort</code> methods, all the sorts on primitives use quicksort, and the sorts on <code>Object[]</code> use mergesort.  This is because stable sort does not matter for primitives; equal primitives are not distinguishable from each other.</p>

<p>Yes, you need the <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions" rel="nofollow">offline_access and publish_stream</a> extended permission from the users.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the chosen filter, I'd like the OpenDialog to 'look' in different directries.
Something like:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TForm1.FileOpen1OpenDialogTypeChange(Sender: TObject);
// This does not work as intended...
var
  Dialog: TOpenDialog;
  FilterIndex: Integer;
  FilterExt: string;
  Path: string;
begin { TForm1.actFileOpenOpenDialogTypeChange }
  Dialog := Sender as TOpenDialog;
  FilterIndex := Dialog.FilterIndex;
  FilterExt := ExtFromFilter(Dialog.Filter, FilterIndex);
  GetIniPathForExtension(FilterExt, Path);
  if DirectoryExists(Path) and
     (Path &lt;&gt; IncludeTrailingPathDelimiter(Dialog.InitialDir)) then
  begin
    // those two statements don't have the desired effect
    // but illustrate what is meant to happen:
    Dialog.FileName := Path + '*' + FilterExt;
    Dialog.InitialDir := Path;
  end;
end;  { TForm1.actFileOpenOpenDialogTypeChange }

<p>I can't find any way to let the dialog update itself to the new directory.
I've tried calling OpenDialog.Execute, but that starts another OpenDialog without closing the current one...</p>

<p>I'm having a really big problem with live binding in jQuery 1.4. I want to bind a hover event to the div.message elements and fade in the controls. They are hidden by default. This is easy when using <code>.hover()</code>, but doesn't bind new items that are added via ajax. I've tried <code>.live()</code> with no success. It fires the <code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code> events every time the cursor moves over the various contents of the messages. As you can imagine this makes the controls flicker. I want the the controls to fade in when the mouse is over the message. But I need to bind the effect to new messages as they are loaded. I am apposed to binding hover events as messages are loaded. I would prefer a solution like live, but works exactly like hover. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="messages"&gt;
    &lt;div class="message"&gt;
        &lt;div class="controls"&gt;
            &lt;a href="dosomthing"&gt;
                do somthing
            &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a href="dosomthing"&gt;
                do somthing
            &lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="message"&gt;
        &lt;div class="controls"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

<p>Your rewrites should be working correctly, but WordPress doesn't see your modifications. The reason for this is that WordPress reads from <code>$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']</code>, which will always contain the <em>original</em> request URI, instead of the resulting one from the <code>mod_rewrite</code> operations.</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with actually using WordPress, but I have looked at some of the source code for some other questions, and it seems it will also attempt to use <code>$_SERVER['PATH_INFO']</code>, if it's provided. Consequently, you can try this:</p>

<pre><code>AcceptPathInfo On
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

RewriteRule ^fastigheter-(spanien|usa)/([^\./]+)$ property/$2&amp;lang=sv
RewriteRule ^properties-(spain|usa)/([^\./]+)$    property/$2&amp;lang=en

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule .* /index.php/$0 [L]
</code></pre>

<p>I find that using <code>PATH_INFO</code> is problematic though (and typically won't work in a per-directory context, although I don't think that I've determined why yet), and generally recommend against it.</p>

<p>Your other option involves working a bit on the PHP side as well. You can do something similar to what <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3378761/wordpress-custom-rewrite-rules-htaccess-or-functions-php/3379441#3379441">Anraiki suggested</a>, or you can just tell <code>$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']</code> to be what you're expecting.</p>

<p>If <code>mod_rewrite</code> performs a redirection, the <code>REQUEST_URI</code> as the module sees it is stored in the server's <code>REDIRECT_URL</code> variable. So, adjusting the rewrite ruleset a bit, we can do this:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# Force L on these rules to cause the REQUEST_URI to be changed (so that
# REDIRECT_URL will end up with the rewritten value we want)
RewriteRule ^fastigheter-(spanien|usa)/([^\./]+)$ property/$2&amp;lang=sv [L]
RewriteRule ^properties-(spain|usa)/([^\./]+)$    property/$2&amp;lang=en [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</code></pre>

<p>Then, somewhere early on in the WordPress processing (such as in <code>index.php</code>, since you shouldn't likely need to update that file with subsequent WordPress releases), you could do the following:</p>

<pre><code>if (!empty($_SERVER['REDIRECT_URL']))
    $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = $_SERVER['REDIRECT_URL'];
</code></pre>

<p>There may very well be a way to define your behaviour in WordPress using the permalink settings themselves, since it does iterate over that rule list in parsing the request, but I'm not entirely clear on the details of this as I've never used it myself. If this is possible, I would consider it the recommended way of handling this situation, but either way hopefully one of these options should get things working for you.</p>

<p>What happens if you use "{0:F2}"?</p>

<p>To workaround that, you can use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/delegate/" rel="nofollow"><code>delegate</code></a> added in version <strong><em>1.4.2</em></strong> instead like this:</p>

<pre><code>$("#container").delegate("div", "hover", function(){
    // your code....
});
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>.delegate()</p>
  
  <p>Description: Attach a handler to one
  or more events for all elements that
  match the selector, <strong>now or in the
  future</strong>, based on a specific set of
  root elements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My <em>initial</em> idea would be to set up a 15x3 matrix of resizable images. The leftmost and righmost of the 15 would be the inner and outer table sides of the boards and the central one would be the bar.</p>

<p>The three-high dimension would be the middle of the board (no image) with the triangular images when the pieces are placed at top and bottom.</p>

<p>Then I would see how that worked out with resizing. If no good, change it.</p>

<p>I'd make these all the same size except possibly the outer table edge since you don't need to put any pieces there.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>space to show the dice throws and doubling cube.</li>
<li>a way to offset the pieces slightly if you end up with six or more at one point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps a good move would be to fire up the Windows backgammon game and see how it does it.</p>

<p>I use a <code>struct</code> whenever I need an aggregate of <code>public</code> of public data members (as opposed to <code>class</code>, which I use for types that come with a certain level of abstractions and have their data <code>private</code>). </p>

<p>Whether or not such a data aggregate has member functions doesn't matter to me. In fact, I rarely ever write a <code>struct</code> without also providing at least one constructor for it. </p>

<p>I was wondering if there are any good vb.net code repositories around where people share code they have written, widgets they have developed, classes developed?  I hate re-inventing the wheel.</p>

<p>Apps can receive and respond to location events in the background in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Applications can register for significant location changes only (your app runs in the background when a significant change in location occurs).</li>
<li>An application can declare itself as a continuous background location application (full-time background processing in response to all location events).</li>
</ol>

<p>Because its easy! From Java 1.1 to Java 1.4 just tiny language features were introduced (<code>strictfp</code> for example). So why restrict yourself if you don't need to. So lets say you write a <code>StringUtil</code> class or you parse Word files then is simply does't matter. Just starting with Java 5 you have language improvement and from Java 1.0 to Java 1.1 of course inner classes.</p>

<p>This is just for the language and not so much for the libraries. There are interesting additions of course.</p>

<p>If I understand your question right, you are asking whether you can <em>execute JavaScript code</em> from C#, and then pass the result (which in your example would be a JavaScript Array object) into C# code.</p>

<p>The answer is: Of course it’s theoretically possible, but you would need to have an actual JavaScript interpreter to execute the JavaScript. You’ll have to find one or write your own, but given that JavaScript is a full-blown programming language, and writing interpreters for such a large and full-featured programming language is quite an undertaking, I suspect that you won’t find a complete ready-made solution, nor will you be able to write one unless your dedication exceeds that of all other die-hard C#-and-JavaScript fans worldwide.</p>

<p>However, with a bit of trickery, you <em>might</em> be able to coerce an existing JavaScript interpreter to do what you want. For obvious reasons, all browsers have such an interpreter, including Internet Explorer, which you can access using the WinForms WebBrowser control. Thus, you could try the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have your C# code generate an HTML file containing the JavaScript you downloaded plus some JavaScript that turns it into JSON (you appear to have already found something that does this) and outputs it in the browser.</li>
<li>Open that HTML file in the WebBrowser control, have it execute the JavaScript, and then read the contents of the website back, now that it contains the result of the executed JavaScript.</li>
<li>Turn the JSON into a C# array using <code>DataContractJsonSerializer</code> as you suggested.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a pretty roundabout way to do it, but it is the best I can think of.</p>

<p>I have to wonder, though, why you are retrieving a JavaScript file from the web in the first place. What generates this JavaScript file? Whatever generates it, surely could generate some properly readable stuff instead (e.g. an XML file)? If it is not generated but written by humans, then why is it written in JavaScript instead of XML, CSV, or some other data format? Hopefully with these thoughts you might be able to find a solution that doesn’t require JavaScript trickery like the above.</p>

<p>Interfacing between the Winforms and OpenGL models of states and events can be very tricky get right.  My advice is to follow the structure of some other code that does this successfully.  A good choice would be the implementation of SimpleOpenGLControl in the Tao Framework.    </p>

<p>Another option would be to just make use of this class rather than implementing your own OpenGL control. Either way, the following may be useful - it highlights some of the issues when there are multiple controls:</p>

<p><a href="http://slizerboy.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/multiopenglcontrol/" rel="nofollow">http://slizerboy.wordpress.com/2010/04/14/multiopenglcontrol/</a>   </p>

<p>I currently have this class that another programmer in my team coded:  </p>

<pre><code>public static class SoapExecuter
{
    private static readonly ILog logger;

    public static Exception ExecuterException { get; private set; }

    public static bool IsSoapException
    {
        get 
        {
            if (ExecuterException == null)
                return false;

            return ExecuterException.GetType() == typeof(SoapException);
        }
    }

    public static bool Execute(Action action)
    {
        ExecuterException = null;
        bool passed = false;

        try
        {
            action();
            passed = true;
        }
        catch (SoapException se)
        {
            ExecuterException = se;
            logger.log(se);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            ExecuterException = ex;  
            logger.log(ex);
        }

        return passed;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is not very idiomatic and I would like to change it to something that happens within the try...catch clause.<br>
Is there a way to not violate DRY and still stay within the idioms the language offers?<br>
Of course I can inherit from the SoapException and log it but I'll have to catch a SoapException and create a new exception object that wraps it and then throw it only to be silenced one level above.<br>
Any idea guys?</p>

<p>I had a look at the generated assembly for each of these techniques, using the following program:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;new&gt;

char blob[128];

int main() {
    void *pLocation = blob;
    char pattern = 'x';
#ifdef CAST
    *reinterpret_cast&lt;char*&gt;(pLocation) = pattern;
#else
    ::new(pLocation) char(pattern);
#endif
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using g++ 4.4.3 on Linux 64-bits with default compiler flags.</p>

<p>The relevant part of the asm for <strong>placement new</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>    movb    $120, -1(%rbp)
    movq    -16(%rbp), %rax
    movq    %rax, %rsi
    movl    $1, %edi
    call    _ZnwmPv
    movq    %rax, %rdx
    testq   %rdx, %rdx
    je  .L5
    movzbl  -1(%rbp), %edx
    movb    %dl, (%rax)
.L5:
</code></pre>

<p>From what I gather, this actually calls the placement new operator, and checks its return value, even though it always succeeds. It then proceeds to write the value of <code>x</code> into the returned memory.</p>

<p>And for the <strong><code>reinterpret_cast</code></strong>:</p>

<pre><code>    movb    $120, -1(%rbp)
    movq    -16(%rbp), %rax
    movzbl  -1(%rbp), %edx
    movb    %dl, (%rax)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that these instructions are identical to the first two and the last two of the placement <code>new</code> version.</p>

<p>Using <code>-O1</code>, both pieces of code generate <em>identical</em> assembly:</p>

<pre><code>movb    $120, blob(%rip)
</code></pre>

<p>So, if you're worried about performance, don't be. Any other sane compiler will probably reduce both to the same code as well.</p>

<p>I think the most common reason is, that new features introduced in later versions are not used anyway. I mean, if a library does not use new features like generics or advanced concurrency features, there is no compatibility overhead at all.</p>

<p>Assuming you get a network stream you could do something like the code below.</p>

<p>The <code>Main()</code> sub gets a network stream and reads it until the end. It passed the bytes over to the <code>PlayBuffer</code> class which appends the bytes to the end of a MemoryStream. When you use the <code>Read()</code> method on the <code>PlayBuffer</code>, it reads from the start and keeps a pointer to where you have read to. The locking is there so that you can write and read to the stream from separate threads. I have not provided code which uses Read(). It's just to give an idea. If you are getting continous bytes, then you could allocate a large buffer and once at the end, you start writing at the beginning again (ring-buffer).</p>

<p><strong>[Edit - modified code to write and read at the same time]</strong></p>

<p>I have not completely tested the code, but the PlayBuffer class inherits a stream and should be able to write and read at the same time, as long as one thread writes and the other just reads.</p>

<p>I guess it's because <code>with</code> must be preceded by <code>new</code>.</p>

<p>So is there any way to do this ?</p>

<p>it is possible to protect a .swf file from decompilation?</p>

<p>i've been reading about compiling class libraries in a .swc file for distribution without revealing the code - possibly selling it.  however, there are .swf decompilers you can use to expose the code, and a .swc file is simply a .zip archive, so changing myswc.swc to myswc.zip will reveal the .swf files of the library.</p>

<p>just curious, mostly.</p>

<p>I'm trying to read a line of text from a text file and put each line into a Map so that I can delete duplicate words (e.g. test test) and print out the lines without the duplicate words.  I must be doing something wrong though because I basically get just one line as my key, vs each line being read one at a time.  Any thoughts?  Thanks.</p>

<pre><code>public DeleteDup(File f) throws IOException {

    line = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;();
    try {
        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(f));
        Integer lineCount = 0;
        for (String s = null; (s = in.readLine()) != null;) {
            line.put(s, lineCount);
            lineCount++;
            System.out.println("s: " + s);
        }
    }
    catch(IOException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();

<p>Hello All,</p>

<p>I am having 2 pop up screens in my (Main) jsp. </p>

<p>In the first pop-up the user will update the required information(Update) and after submitting the info, a new pop up will be shown that shows the modifications(View).</p>

<p>I would like to refresh the (Main ) page when the user clicks on the close "X" in the view page.</p>

<p>I tried to use some scripts like (below) in the view page, but it did not work:

<p>You can use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AbsoluteLayout.html" rel="nofollow">AbsoluteLayout</a>. There you can set the exact coordinates of the UI element. However, I would no really recommend to use in any situation, because you can get in trouble with different screen size/resolution.</p>

<p>I would use <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/" rel="nofollow">Fiddler</a> to monitor what is sent in the POST data when you submit the page. (Also, it's better to give example sites with English text as most people on SO don't read Cyrillic)</p>

<p>Then I would use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httpwebrequest.aspx" rel="nofollow">HttpWebRequest</a> and perform the same POST from code. Example of doing a POST can be found at <a href="http://www.netomatix.com/httppostdata.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.netomatix.com/httppostdata.aspx</a>.</p>

<p>I really enjoy the JDBC abstraction in Java. I don't care what database type I am connecting to, or what driver is being used. That's all set up in the DataSource object, and once it's done, we just use connections. It's such a consistent API in order to commit/rollback, perform transactions, and you only need to learn it once, and move on with your life. MySQL/Oracle - no worries, it's all the same (except for the SQL differences)</p>

<p>Four questions:
1. What is the most popular equivalent for c++/c.
2. What is the best?
3. Is there any api that mirrors the java api for connections? Something very similar?
4. I really like the Dao/DaoImpl pattern often employed in Java. Do people do this same pattern in c++. </p>

<p>Thanks guys!</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I have some basic hyperlinks (they're tags dynamically generated by Wordpress).</p>

<p>Here's the code that generates them:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;?php the_tags('Tags: ', ', ', '&lt;br /&gt;'); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Everything works in all modern browsers (including IE8). However, in IE7, it looks the same, the link is THERE, with all of the properties <strong>EXCEPT</strong> the hyperlink functionality...</p>

<p>Any idea why?</p>

<p>i'm using <a href="http://watin.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">watin</a>,to control a firefox browser,but there's no support for events like page load,&amp; progress..
i need a way to expose this events through .net,i tried a bit with xpcom from geckofx but with no vain due to lack of documentation,,
thanx in advance</p>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I can think of one approach to do that:</p>

<p>1) Check where the form submits to. Normally, form have an action tag indicating the url to which the form info is sent.</p>

<p>2) Check the http method.</p>

<p>3) Collect the names of the input fields in the form. Your variables in asp.net have to be named with the same names.</p>

<p>4) Create a manual web request to this url using this method and attach all the variables you need to send.</p>

<p>Some example code:</p>

<pre><code>HttpWebRequest request = HttpWebRequest.Create("yourFormUrl");
request.Method = "POST"
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that this is what you want to do. </p>

<p>First let's see if we can get a more detailed error message than "Error connecting to mysql".<br>
What's the output of:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
error_reporting(E_ALL); ini_set('display_errors', 1);
echo 'mysql extension: ', extension_loaded('mysql') ? 'ok' : 'NOT ok', "&lt;br /&gt;\n";
echo 'mysql_connect: ', function_exists('mysql_connect') ? 'ok' : 'NOT ok', "&lt;br /&gt;\n";
mysql_connect('fill in', 'the right', 'values here') or die(mysql_error());
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>Try putting this javascript code in your popup window:</p>

<pre><code>window.onunload = function(){
  window.opener.location.reload();
};
</code></pre>

<pre><code>// I’m assuming you have a regex for each thing you want to replace
List&lt;string&gt; multiplePatterns = [...];

string result = Regex.Replace(input, string.Join("|", multiplePatterns), "");
</code></pre>

<p>It is because integer arithmetic always wraps it's result except for the case of (Division/Remainder By Zero).<br>
In case of float, when there is an overflow or underflow, the wrapping goes to 0, infinity or NaN.<br>
During the overflow, it gives infinity and during underflow, it gives 0.<br>
Again there are positive &amp; negative overflow/underflow.<br>
Try:</p>

<pre><code>float a = -1000;
float b = a/0;
System.out.println("b=" +b);
</code></pre>

<p>This gives a negative overflow
<br><br>Output</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>b=-Infinity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly positive underflow will result in 0 and negative underflow in -0.<br>
Certain operations can also result in returning a NaN(Not a Number) by float/double.<br>
For eg:<br></p>

<pre><code>float a = -1000;
double b = Math.sqrt(a);
System.out.println("b=" +b);
</code></pre>

<p>Output<br></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>b=NaN</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use the regexp divider <code>|</code>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;/?html&gt;|&lt;/?head&gt;|&lt;/?div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Why don't you use created_at/updated_at (rails will handle these for you)? </p>

<p>A discussion in Ruby Forum regarding this back in 2008 is <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/169734" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>It seems better to use DATETIME to do these kind of things in Rails.</p>

<p>Firstly get a copy of TCPView from the <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com" rel="nofollow">Sysinternals</a> suite (now run by Microsoft) and use it to monitor which app is using the port you want to use.</p>

<p>I would hazard a guess that if the app works fine as a stand alone (as you say it does) and you are trying to use the same port in the service then perhaps the service app is opening up the port at startup without you realizing it and then when you try to open the port manually the app finds it already in use. Or somehow the app is trying to open the port twice. The first time is successful but, maybe due to an event or an unexpected code path, the app tries to open it a second time and fails. TCPView will help spot this.</p>

<pre><code>[self performSelector:@selector(testFunc) withObject:msg afterDelay:0];
</code></pre>

<p>Should be:</p>

<pre><code>[self performSelector:@selector(testFunc:) withObject:msg afterDelay:0];
</code></pre>

<p>I want to create a thumbnail from an image uploaded from user on webpage. I want to create a image gallery where i can show all images preview as thumbnail and when user clicks he can see enlarged image.</p>

<p>ODBC it the answer for question 1. (The JDBC API was modeled after ODBC.)</p>

<p>For a while I've been playing with the idea of long polling for my notification system, but i've never been able to think of a way to make it more efficient for my backend. </p>

<p>Most implementations I have seen hold the connection open, and the php queries the database server every few seconds to see if new data has been aded. This strikes me as no better than having the javascript repetitively poll the server. </p>

<p>In either case I have my database servers being hit tens thousands of times, which is understandably not particularly desirable. </p>

<p>Are there any systems in place that could 'alert' the executing/sleeping long polling script to the new data?</p>

<p>We have variable <code>$country</code>, it can give ~50 different values.</p>

<p>And variable <code>$id</code>.</p>

<p>What we should do is to give a value for <code>$id</code> corresponding to <code>$country</code> value, like:</p>

<pre><code>if ($country = 'USA') { $id = 'usa_type'; }
else if ($country = 'France') { $id = 'france_type'; }
else if ($country = 'German') { $id = 'german_type'; }
else if ($country = 'Spain') { $id = 'spain_type'; }
...
...
...
else if ($country = 'Urugway') { $id = 'urugway_type'; }
else { $id = 'undefined'; }
</code></pre>

<p><code>else if</code> statement repeats everytime, and other data is typical. </p>

<p>Is there a way to make this code shorter? </p>

<p>Like:</p>

<pre><code>[france]:'france_type;
[england]:'england_type;
...
[else]:'undefined'
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You have to edit your php.ini 
<br>
Find the line with Memory limit statement and change its default value for something bigger - for example 128M</p>

<p>The real question is, what are you trying to do in that error catching block?</p>

<p>There are different ways to hook into different kinds of errors.   What kind of code specifically are you looking to wrap in a block like that?</p>

<p>What I did to get around this was to create a base class for all my activities where I store global data. In the first activity, I saved the context in a variable in my base class like so:</p>

<p>Base Class</p>

<pre><code>public static Context myucontext; 
</code></pre>

<p>First Activity derived from the Base Class</p>

<pre><code>mycontext = this
</code></pre>

<p>Then I use mycontext instead of getApplicationContext when creating dialogs. </p>

<pre><code>AlertDialog alertDialog = new AlertDialog.Builder(mycontext).create();
</code></pre>

<p>I have a particular problem with config files and deployment. When I deploy my project, it eventually moves to two different branches: staging and production (using SVN here)</p>

<p>I make the branch from my local working copy of the project. What this ends up doing is overwriting staging and development's copy of the config files, so I manually have to go in and make the correct changes every time I deploy.</p>

<p>Does it make sense to delete the config files from SVN completely since it's set in stone? Or is there another way in doing this?</p>

<p>To be honest, your question isn't particularly clear - it's not obvious why you've got the <code>lineCount</code>, or what <code>deleteDuplicates</code> will do, or why you've named the <code>line</code> variable that way when it's not actually a line - it's a map from lines to the last line number on which that line appeared.</p>

<p>Unless you need the line numbers, I'd use a <code>Set&lt;String&gt;</code> instead.</p>

<p>However, all that aside, if you look at the <code>keySet</code> of <code>line</code> afterwards, it <em>will</em> be all the lines. That's assuming that the text file is genuinely in the default encoding for your system (which is what <code>FileReader</code> uses, unfortunately - I generally use <code>InputStreamReader</code> and specify the encoding explicitly).</p>

<p>If you could give us a short but <em>complete</em> program, the text file you're using as input, the expected output and the actual output, that would be helpful.</p>

<p>I've a hosted GIT repository with limited disk space available but connected with a RedMine system.
I'm packaging some software and pushing and pulling on the repository, I'm run out of space. Now I need to clean (the packages are note needed anymore).
How can I delete these packages from the remote repository history, considering that I cannot re-create the repository (it's too strictly linked to RedMine)?</p>

<p>Some time ago I have looked after exactly that sort of thing, but couldn't find a solution either. Nowadays I'm glad not to implement it anyway for the following reason:</p>

<p><em>Imagine a user executes the open dialog. He knows where to find the required file and navigates to that folder. Now he can't see the file and realizes that the filter is set wrong. He changes the filter and naturally expects the folder to stay the same.</em></p>

<p>Try and make some observations: in most of the cases a user first selects the folder and after that the file type.</p>

<p>Conversion method:</p>

<pre><code>public Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; ToPropertyDictionary(User theUser)
{
  Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; result = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;();
  result.Add("Name", theUser.Name);
  result.Add("LastName", theUser.Name);
  return result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Called by:</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerable&lt;Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;&gt; x =
  from u in Users.AsEnumerable()  //ensure local execution by using AsEnumerable
  select ToPropertyDictionary(u);
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to everything else, I would highly recommend the <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201752840" rel="nofollow">Database Design for Mere Mortals</a> book by Michael Hernandez. It's very well written, touches on all the important points, works out the good and bad of database design, and is very useful overall.</p>

<p>It's not SQL Server specific, but all the concepts and ideas put forward here absolutely apply to anyone doing any serious work in SQL Server.</p>

<p>Once you've designed and set up your database, you might need to query it :-) and then I'd recommend the companion book <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321444434" rel="nofollow">SQL Queries for Mere Mortals</a> which covers the querying techniques - what are the various JOIN types, what do they do, etc.</p>

<p>can i use mootools on the serverside with nodejs?</p>

<p>If so, can someone give an example?</p>

<p>i ended up taking the width of the container div and manually spacing each element in it.</p>

<pre><code>    function alignHand(){
            var cards = $(".inHand");

            var width = $('#hand').width() - 140;
            cards.each(function(e){
                    totalWidth = totalWidth + 1;
                    $(this).addClass('cardInHand' + totalWidth);
                    $(this).css('position','absolute');
                    $(this).css('left',width/cards.length * (totalWidth - 1) + 'px');

            });
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>switch</code> control structure . It will make your code shorter.</p>

<p>The standard for cross platform database connectivity is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity" rel="nofollow">ODBC</a>. However, this is a very large C API which can take some getting used to (but works well once you are used to it). There are  a lot of C++ wrapper libraries for it, but I can't recommend any of them as I've always used my own wrapper. Do a search for "c++ database library" using the SO google search at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search">http://stackoverflow.com/search</a> to see lots of questions on this topic.</p>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>looking at your example you could do something like</p>

<pre><code>$id = strtolower($country) + '_type';
</code></pre>

<p>Hello, I'd like to ask how could I load textures from program resources.</p>

<p>This code works fine, but its only from file. How about loading from resources?</p>

<pre><code>texture = TextureLoader.FromFile(device, "file.png");
</code></pre>

<p>You could just create <code>$id</code> from <code>$country</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$id = strtolower($country) . '_type';
</code></pre>

<p>If you first need to determine the validity of <code>$country</code>, put all your countries in an array, then use <a href="http://uk.php.net/manual/en/function.in-array.php" rel="nofollow"><code>in_array</code></a> to determine if <code>$country</code> is valid:</p>

<pre><code>$countries = array('USA', 'France', 'Germany', 'Spain', 'Uruguay');
if (in_array($country, $countries)) {
    $id = strtolower($country) . '_type';
}
</code></pre>

<p>hi,</p>

<p>I'm using a forum with several topics and node comments module to add comment nodes to the topics.</p>

<p>I'm importing an external database and adding the relationships directly in mysql to the node_comments table.</p>

<p>However before to see the comments of a quesition I need to add a random comment in drupal to this question. Which is probably triggering a function and getting new values from the table.</p>

<p>Is there a way to simulate this, I cannot add a comment and delete it for all thousands nodes in my Drupal ?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You can use bunch update in first place:</p>

<pre><code>Many.objects.filter(one=one).update(one=None)
</code></pre>

<p>I think that Django deletes related object on program level (without on delete cascade in DBMS). So probably your objects are in some kind of cache and Django still thinks that they are related to <code>one</code> object.</p>

<p>Try to list related objects before you delete.</p>

<pre><code>print one.many_set
one.delete()
</code></pre>

<p>If you still have any objects in this set you probably should fetch <code>one</code> from DB again, and then delete. Or you can use bunch delete:</p>

<pre><code>One.objects.filter(&lt;cryteria&gt;).delete()
</code></pre>

<p>Place all countries and codes in array like this:</p>

<pre><code>$countries = array( "0" =&gt; array("country_name" =&gt; "usa", 
                                 "country_type" =&gt; "001" ) ,

                    "1" =&gt; array("country_name" =&gt; "uae", 
                                 "country_type" =&gt; "002" ),

                    -----------------------------
                    -----------------------------

                  );
</code></pre>

<p>Then use loop to compare country name and then get country id.</p>

<pre><code>$country = "usa";

for( $i = 0; $i &lt; count($countries); $i++ ) {
   if( $country == $countries[$i]["country_name"] ){
      $id = $countries[$i]["country_type"];
      break;
   }
}

echo $id;

<p>I am writing an addin to Office (both 2007 and 2010), and have so far used the Fluent Ribbon XML to customize the different ribbons.<br>
The problem I am having now with that approach, is that I want to have a bit more flexibility in my code, and have different modules add more buttons to the ribbon, without hard coding them in XML - The addin is composed of several disconnected modules, and it doesn't "know" exactly what ribbon elements it might need.</p>

<p>Is there a way to do it? I bumped into the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa338202%28office.12%29.aspx#OfficeCustomizingRibbonUIforDevelopers_Runtime" rel="nofollow">LoadCustomUI</a> method on the Application object, but it is not available in C#. Looks like just what I might have used for my scenario.</p>

<p>Your question isn't clear on how you're trying to perform the redirects in your <code>.htaccess</code> file, so for next time I'd recommend that you post some samples of the code that you've tried so that we can help you more easily.</p>

<p>Based on your Apache tag and the problem you're describing, I'm going to assume that you were using <code>mod_alias</code> though, trying to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Redirect 301 /laser-alignment-resources/presentations.cfm?pres=diaphragm http://www.acquip.com/en/presentations/47-presentation-internal-laser-diaphragm-alignment
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn't work though, as the <code>Redirect</code> directive seems to only examine the path portion of the request, and not the query string.</p>

<p>If you have <code>mod_rewrite</code> available, you can setup rewrite rules for the URLs that you need to redirect based on their query strings. This would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} =pres=diaphragm
RewriteRule ^laser-alignment-resources/presentations\.cfm$ http://www.acquip.com/en/presentations/47-presentation-internal-laser-diaphragm-alignment [R=301,L]

<p>My GMail account has over 200 filters and around 50 lables.
Some days I recieve up to 100 mails; most filtered to lables and archived.</p>

<p>Is there anyway to prevent archived messages being sent to my BlackBerry.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I would like to know if its possible to change the contents of the URL in the browser without reloading the page.
I use jQuery and Ajax to load new parts of my page. When I choose product one, the direct link would be "mysite.com/product1" and product two "mysite.com/product2", but I don't want to reload the site to these pages.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I've read many books about Iphone dev. I'm new to objective c.</p>

<p>Why we need to add property and synthesize?</p>

<p>Can someone explain and relate it to real life story.</p>

<p><strong>Single system</strong></p>

<p>If your application is the only system that changes the database, then you can trigger your listeners only when your application performs changes (ideally only for changes to the entities which are interesting for each listener).</p>

<p><strong>Multiple systems</strong></p>

<p>In the case of multiple systems accessing/changing the database, you can either</p>

<ul>
<li>work with database triggers</li>
</ul>

<p>or if you don't want to do that (I usually avoid it), you can either</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure that all other systems accessing the database will always notify your application (via some messaging mechanism)</li>
</ul>

<p>or if that's not possible</p>

<ul>
<li>you can at least optimize by having only one loop that queries the database frequently, and informs all listeners at once (so you don't have a loop for each listener).</li>
</ul>

<p>Look at the stats of <em>your</em> website, see what combinations of screens <em>your</em> users use, and spend time only on the common ones (>2%).</p>

<p>People with B/W screens (is there such a thing?), text-only browsers, and (CSS or JS) disabled deserve a less then optimal experience, so don't waste time on them.</p>

<p>Backward compatability?  </p>

<p>Changing the level of JVM support, should warrant a major release.  I.e. version 1.x goes to 2.x to indicate this. </p>

<p>Also I believe to have read that to get most coverage in mobile phones, you need to target 1.1.  That may be old though.</p>

<p>Hi all, </p>

<p>I have a Sun One 6.1 web server that proxies requests to a WebLogic app server, and I have created an encryption filter in Java that encrypts the request parameters before it is forwarded to the app server.</p>

<p>The filter is packaged in a WAR file and deployed to the web server root (/). My intention is to pick up all requests, look for certain parameters, encrypt them and forward to the app server.</p>

<p>Problem: Is it correct to deploy a Java filter in this way? The filter does not appear to be detecting the requests or encrypting them. </p>

<p>You will have to add hash <code>#</code> if you want to prevent page from reloading.</p>

<p>The css-tricks.com has an excellent screencast on that, have a look at:</p>

<p>You need to keep apart the CLR (Common Language Runtime) version, and the .NET framework version.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>.NET framework 1.0 and 1.1 are built on <strong>CLR 1.0</strong></p></li>
<li><p>.NET framework versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.5 and 3.5 SP1 are all built on the <strong>CLR 2.0</strong> - the newer framework versions are simply additional functionality delivered in the forms of additional assemblies and namespaces - but the core of the runtime system is still the 2.0 CLR</p></li>
<li><p>.NET framework 4 is built on the new <strong>CLR 4.0</strong> - so this is a totally new kid in town</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you install .NET framework 3.5 SP1, you get:</p>

<ul>
<li>the base CLR version 2.0</li>
<li>the .NET framework functionalities for 2.0 (plus all SP's), 3.0 (plus all SP's), 3.5, 3.5 SP1</li>
</ul>

<p>You do <strong>not</strong> get any support for the CLR 1.0 (.NET 1.0 / 1.1) - if you need that, you'll have to install it separately.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/" rel="nofollow">exec-maven-plugin</a> is the correct answer (though you want the java goal).  You need to bind it to a lifecycle phase.  Look at the <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/usage.html" rel="nofollow">usage page</a> for an example.  In your case, you'd need something like this:</p>

<p>You can also add <code>utm_nooverride=1</code> to your iframe source tag. This will make sure that the page that called your iframe on the 3rd party site will not get credit for the referral, but rather the initial source (AdWords campaign, search query, etc.).</p>

<pre><code>Dim uri As Uri = New Uri("C:\UploadedUserFiles\")

<p>The above statement is wrong, how come you have Uri as a file system path, it should be "http://" or "https://" , if you are trying to upload it to your local asp.net web site project then you must have a url something like <a href="http://localhost:PORT/UploadedUserFiles" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:PORT/UploadedUserFiles</a> ... and you will know port number when you execute project.</p>

<p>I was given an English vocabulary assignment by my teacher.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Choose a random alphabet, say 'a'
  Write a word from the alphabet, say
  'apple' Take the last word 'e' Write a
  word from e, say elephant Now from 't'
  and so on.. No repetition allowed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make a list of 500 words.
Mail the list to the teacher. :)</p>

<p>So Instead of doing it myself, I am working on a Java code which will do my homework for me.
The code seems to be simple.</p>

<p>The core of algorithm:
Pick up a random word from a dictionary, which satisfies the requirment. seek() with RandomAccessFile. Try to put it in a Set with ordering (maybe LinkedHashSet)</p>

<p>But the problem is the huge size of dictionary with around 3 lakh+ enteries. :|
Brute force random algorithms wont work.</p>

<p>What could be the best, quikest and most efficient way out?</p>

<p>*<strong><em>UPDATE :</strong> Now that I have written the code and its working. How can I make it efficient so that it chooses common words?
Any text files containing list of common words around??</em>*</p>

<p>I have a PayPal IPN PHP file set up which assigns all of the IPN post contents variables to variables. This file is only 'hit' from paypal.com (ie nobody should know it's url).</p>

<p>My question is should I take the necessary steps to filter and sanitize the POST data from PayPal or is masking my IPN file name (IPN_082j3f08jasdf.php) enough?</p>

<p>Also, could somebody confirm my sanitize code? It's pretty basic. I run it on EVERYTHING sent via POST or GET and my goal is to prevent any kind of MySQL injections or whatever hackers do.</p>

<pre><code>function filter($data){
 // changes &amp; to &amp;amp;
 // changes " to &amp;quot;
 // removes \ &lt; &gt;

 $data = trim(htmlentities(strip_tags($data)));

 if(get_magic_quotes_gpc()){
  $data = stripslashes($data);
 }
 $data = mysql_real_escape_string($data);

 return $data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can't. Only if you change the hash, like sAc told you.</p>

<p>But.. May I ask WHY? </p>

<p>can I pick multiple items (images/videos) rather then just one item (image/video)</p>

<p>We automate several aspects of Software development using tools. Want to understand </p>

<ol>
<li>What tools the community recommends &amp; why</li>
<li>Which stages of development have more potential for automation </li>
</ol>

<p>To start things off, here are tools I use or know of.</p>

<ol>
<li>Automated code quality checks: <a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">PMD</a></li>
<li>Regression Testing: <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/" rel="nofollow">Selenium</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.molyb.org/confluence/display/molyb/Home" rel="nofollow">Molybdenum</a></li>

<p>If you really need them separate from your main git repo while still living directly within it, you could try:</p>

<ul>
<li>creating a new repo with those script within it</li>
</ul>

<p>and:</p>

<ul>
<li>adding that new repo as a submodule to your repo. Except:
<ul>
<li>a/ those scripts won't live directly in the base directory, but in a subfolder representing the submodule</li>
<li>b/ you need of course to not publish (push) that new repo, in order for other cloning your main repo to not get those setup files</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>or:</p>

<ul>
<li>merging that new repo into your main repo (with the <strong><a href="http://github.com/apenwarr/git-subtree/blob/master/git-subtree.txt" rel="nofollow">subtree project</a></strong>), but:
<ul>
<li>you need to split back your project to get rid of those files</li>
<li>for a project with a large history, and with frequent push, that step (the split) can be long and cumbersome.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I would consider a simpler solution, involving some evolution to your current setup files:</p>

<ul>
<li>a private repo (as in "not pushed") with those setup files</li>
<li>environment variables with the path of your main git repo in order for your setup files (which would <em>not be</em> directly within the base directory of said main repo) to do their job in the right directory (like beginning for instance with a '<code>cd right_main_git_repo_dir</code>').</li>
</ul>

<p>I tried the code in WordPress 3.0.1 and found no problem. You may want to install IE Developer Toolbar and check the tags.</p>

<p>or you could create an array</p>

<pre><code>$country_to_id = array(
  "USA" =&gt; "usa_type",
  "Spain" =&gt; "spain_type_or_whatever",
  ....
);
$country_id = (array_key_exists($country,$country_to_id)) ? $country_to_id[$country] : 'undefined';
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could just use 
    $letter = $name{0};</p>

<p>You should probably cache the thumbnail images, but to create them see:</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27921/what-is-the-best-way-to-create-a-thumbnail-using-asp-net/27938#27938">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27921/what-is-the-best-way-to-create-a-thumbnail-using-asp-net/27938#27938</a></p>

<p>I'm building a small timing application using the MVVM pattern, using entity framework for persistence. At this stage, my logic is pretty thin, as I only need to perform a few calculations and aggregations on related data. At the moment, I have implemented these by writing them in a partial class of the entity class.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>// entity framework generated
partial class Lap {
  int Id { /* boilerplate */ }
  DateTime StartTime { /* etc */ }
  DateTime EndTime { /* etc */ }
}

// in my partial class (written by me)
partial class Lap {
  TimeSpan Duration {
    get { return EndTime - StartTime; }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is it bad practice to drop extra logic straight onto the entity-generated classes? Should I make another domain layer for this logic?</p>

<p>I need both MyISAM tables and InnoDB tables in my database, I am using hbm2ddl to create them. Can I create both MyISAM and InnoDB tables in the same database using Hibenrate hbm2ddl?
It seems that selecting the dialect forces me to use one or the other.</p>

<p>Easiest solution is to just execute the Javascript function that makes the array. Include there a function that makes it an JSON (http://www.json.org/js.html). After that make a XMLHttpRequest (AJAX) to the server and from there extract the JSON to a custom class.</p>

<p>If I may use jQuery, here's an example of the needed Javascript:</p>

<pre><code>var myJSONText = JSON.stringify(deptarray);
(function($){
    $.ajax({
        type: "POST",
        url: "some.aspx",
        data: myJSONText,
        success: function(msg){
            alert( "Data Saved: " + msg );
        }
    });
})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p>Only now need some code to rip the JSON string to an C# Array.</p>

<p>EDIT:<br/>
After looking around a bit, I found Json.NET: <a href="http://json.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http://json.codeplex.com/</a><br/>
There are also a lot of the same questions on Stackoverflow that ask the same.</p>

<p>Dears</p>

<p>I have a django model as following </p>

<pre><code>class Project(models.Model)
      name=models.CharField(max_length=200)

class Application(models.Model)
      proj=models.ForeignKey(Project, null=True, blank=True)
</code></pre>

<p>I need to modify the admin form of the project to be able to assign multiple applications to the project, so in the admin.py I have created a ModelAdmin class for the project as following</p>

<pre><code>class ProjectAdmin(ModelAdmin)
      form=projectForm
      project_apps=[]
</code></pre>

<p>and the project form as following</p>

<pre><code>class ProjectForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
       model = Project

    project_apps =forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=Application.objects.all(),required=False,)
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super(ProjectForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    if self.instance.id is not None:
        selected_items = [ values[0] for values in Application.objects.filter(project=self.instance) ]
        self.fields['project_apps'].initial = selected_items

def save(self,commit=True):
    super(ProjectForm,self).save(commit)
    return self.instance
</code></pre>

<p>by doing this I have a multiple select in the create/edit project form.
what I need is to override the save method to save a reference for the project in the selected applications?</p>

<p>how can I get the selected applications ????</p>

<p>Found solution.</p>

<pre><code>texture = new Bitmap(Properties.Resources.image);
</code></pre>

<p>Did the trick. :)</p>

<p>You are doing the very thing for which partial classes were designed; adding relevant logic to a code-generated class without bogging down the inheritance tree. Keep it up.</p>

<p>Addition:</p>

<p>From a page in the font of all tribal knowledge, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_class" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> (emphasis added):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of partial classes is to
  allow a class's definition to span
  across multiple files. It is
  especially useful for:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Very large classes (where it is cumbersome to navigate with an editor
  through a single file)</li>
  <li>Separation of concerns, in a way similar to aspect-oriented programming
  but without using any extra tools. An
  example is shown below.</li>
  <li>Allowing multiple developers to work on a single class at the same
  time without the need for later
  merging files in source control.</li>
  <li>Allowing a separation between the class interface and the
  implementation-related definitions
  (Separate definitions of the public
  and private parts)</li>
  <li><em>Easing the writing of code generators, such as visual designers.
  This is perhaps the most useful
  reason.</em> It is a challenge to develop
  code generators that can manage the
  generated code when it is placed in
  the human-written code:
  <ul>
  <li>Requires a lot of parsing of unnecessary code, just to find a
  place to insert the generated code.
  Altering the code is also a problem.
  Poorly written generators hold the
  potential risk of damaging the entire
  file.</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Using partial classes, the code
  generator processes a separate file,
  and is thus alleviated from all the
  above mentioned problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can write a simple function for this:</p>

<pre><code>sub get {
    my ($hash, $key) = @_;
    die "No such key: $key" unless exists $hash-&gt;{$key};
    return $hash-&gt;{$key};
}

my %hash = (...);    
my $val = get(\%hash, "mykey");
</code></pre>

jQuery.ajax({type: "POST", url: u, data: query, success: function(msg) { if(t==':eval') eval(msg); else document.getElementById(t).innerHTML=msg; } });

       for(int i=0;i&lt;len;i++)System.out.println(s[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>but it's not working </p>

<p>If an exception is thrown, you'll print the stack trace, but never return anything. That's what the compiler is complaining about.</p>

<p>In general, "handling" exceptions like this is a <em>really bad idea</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Log any exception information somewhere more appropriate than just the console</li>
<li>Don't catch bare <code>Exception</code> - catch specific exceptions</li>
<li>If you can't actually handle an exception, let it propagate up the call stack</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case I'd suggest you should probably just change your method to declare which exceptions might be thrown, and remove the try/catch block.</p>

<p>If you genuinely want to catch exceptions (specific ones, mind) then you'll need to work out what you want to return in that case.</p>

<p>Sounds like what you really want is not to handle that exception inside <code>Execute</code> at all. The responsibility for handling the exception seems to lie with the code that calls <code>Execute</code>.</p>

<p>Of course you can still catch it, store it in <code>ExecuterException</code>, log it, and then rethrow it using <code>throw;</code> — but the purpose of <code>ExecuterException</code> eludes me. It seems that you only need it for <code>IsSoapException</code>, which in turn is much better written as <code>ExecuterException is SoapException</code> anyway, which even takes care of nullness and subclasses.</p>

<p>I don’t think anyone can be of any further help than this without seeing the code that <em>uses</em> the code you posted. If <em>that</em> code queries <code>ExecuterException</code> only immediately after calling <code>Execute</code>, then you can (and should) probably just change it to a try/catch in that code. If it actually queries <code>ExecuterException</code> elsewhere, then you could consider having <em>that</em> code store the reference instead, but either way, it would mean that the code is pretty entangled spaghetti code and probably requires a major rewrite anyway.</p>

<p>(By the way, just to nitpick, the first of the two catch clauses in your code is completely redundant. If you remove it you get exactly the same behaviour — unless <code>logger.log</code> has a special overload for <code>SoapException</code>, but then you should probably restructure that too.)</p>

<p>I am not as familiar with Java's exception packages as with those of .NET. I'm in a situation where, if programming in C#, I would throw a <code>System.InvalidOperationException</code>. </p>

<p>Before creating my own <code>java.lang.RuntimeException</code> subclass, I need to know if there is a similar exception type I should throw in Java.</p>

<p>The exact scenario is:</p>

<p>My class is a value object that provides an <code>int intValue()</code> method, returning an int. However, in some situations, the current value cannot be provided as an int, so this class also provides a <code>boolean isInteger()</code> to allow API users to know when <code>intValue()</code> can be safely invoked.</p>

<p>If a caller calls <code>intValue()</code> when <code>isInteger()</code> is <code>false</code>, an exception should be thrown. </p>

<p>And the question is: What type of exception?</p>

<p>I know that this question might not have a <em>correct</em> answer, but considering that I don't have lots of experience designing Java APIs, I want to know from other Java developers what they would expect to be thrown in this scenario.</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for posting, i read the given links, how i understood from there, the war file and the ejb jar should be deployed to artifactory (company repository), so that its could be added as dependency in pom file from ear. </p>

<p>Also an ear could contain more than one war file (because i believe that my ear will contain more than one war file) ?</p>

<p>Please let me know if i understood right this...</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Try to split with this regular expression:</p>

<pre><code>str.split("\\b-")
</code></pre>

<p>The word boundary <code>\b</code> should only match before or after a digit so that in combination with <code>-</code> only the following <code>-</code> as the range indicator is matched:</p>

<pre><code>-3-5, -3--5 , 3-5,3-+5,-3-+5
  ^     ^      ^   ^     ^
</code></pre>

<p>No, you can't backup the data directory while the database service is running. You could backup the WAL-segments for a point in time recovery when you want to restore. You have to make sure you test your recovery as well, it's a litte more complicated then pgrestore of an ordinary dump.</p>

<p>No. I don't know why you would want to do this. If you have multiple sites, the correct way to serve them is with multiple WSGI instances, each pointing at separate settings.py and urls.py files.</p>

<p>Edit after comment: This has nothing to do with the sites framework, which is completely optional. As I say, if you want to serve multiple sites, use multiple <code>.wsgi</code> scripts each pointing to a separate <code>urls.py</code> and <code>settings.py</code>. All the rest of the code can be the same.</p>

<p>jQuery - How do you convert <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;p /&gt;</code> and such to new line?</p>

<p>Does jQuery have a built in <code>br2nl()</code> function - this is for converting new lines tags to user-friendly textfield versions.</p>

<p>I've got pretty much the same question as: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/64364/jabber-openfire-server-v360a-how-do-i-use-hybrid-authentication">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/64364/jabber-openfire-server-v360a-how-do-i-use-hybrid-authentication</a></p>

<p>But when I followed the instructions there, and I go into the Admin interface > Users and Groups > Create New User, I get the following message:</p>

<pre><code>Not allowed: the user account system is read-only. 
</code></pre>

<p>That tells me that the system is trying to add to the LDAP structure, and not to the database.  Does anyone have a working config that allows both LDAP and Database users to login, and to be able to create Database Users?</p>

<p>I believe in the latest version of Openfire, settings are pulled from the database but not the openfire.xml file.  Unfortunately, there's little documentation on their site.</p>

<p>Your first problem is caused by <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_negotiation.html#multiviews" rel="nofollow"><code>MultiViews</code></a>, which is resolving the non-existent resource <code>foo/bar</code> to the existing file <code>foo.py</code>, then likely passing it <code>PATH_INFO</code> of <code>/bar</code>. You can disable it in your <code>.htaccess</code> file by modifying your <code>Options</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Options -MultiViews +ExecCGI
</code></pre>

<p>Using your original ruleset with <code>MultiViews</code> disabled should solve your problem. For the sake of completeness though, the reason why the query string ends up being <code>q=main.py</code> is because of the how the request is processed when you remove the rewrite conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>mod_rewrite</code> receives the request, and <code>foo/bar</code> matches <code>.*</code> and is rewritten to <code>main.py?q=foo/bar</code></li>
<li><code>mod_rewrite</code> performs an internal redirect and assigns itself as the handler</li>
<li>The redirect is re-processed by <code>mod_rewrite</code>, and <code>main.py</code> matches <code>.*</code> and is rewritten to <code>main.py?q=main.py</code></li>
<li><code>mod_rewrite</code> performs an internal redirect and assigns itself as the handler</li>
<li>The redirect is re-processed by <code>mod_rewrite</code>, and <code>main.py</code> matches <code>.*</code> and is rewritten to <code>main.py?q=main.py</code></li>
<li><code>mod_rewrite</code> realizes that you're going to enter an infinite loop redirecting the same request to itself, and stops the redirection process</li>
</ul>

<p>I think you're new to OOP, too. This is the reason why you don't understand the use of properties. I've not read any iphone development book and i don't know if they talk about OOP, but I suggest you to focus on this subject before.</p>

<p>Anyway you use properties to decouple data from access and manipulation of data.</p>

<p>i believe u would have to use libxml-ruby for that</p>

<pre><code>gem 'libxml-ruby', '&gt;= 0.8.3'
require 'xml'

xml = open("http://ffffound.com/feed")
parser = XML::Parser.string(xml, :options =&gt;XML::Parser::Options::RECOVER)
doc = parser.parse
doc.find("channel").first.find("items").each do |item|
  puts item.find("media:content").first
  #and just guessing you want that url thingy
  puts item.find("media:content").first.attributes.get_attribute("url").value
end
</code></pre>

<p>i hope that points u in the right direction ;)</p>

<p>Let's say I have a method called foo. What's the difference between:</p>

<pre><code>[self foo];
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>[self performSelector:@selector(foo)];
</code></pre>

<p>Are they the same? The first one seems so much easier, so why would you ever want to use the second one?</p>

<p>Your question is not very clear.</p>

<p>But while going through your code  snippet, I think  you tried to remove duplicate words in each line.</p>

<p>Following code snippet might be helpful.</p>

<pre><code>public class StackOverflow {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        List&lt;Set&lt;String&gt;&gt; unique = new ArrayList&lt;Set&lt;String&gt;&gt;();

        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
                 new FileReader("C:\\temp\\testfile.txt"));

        String line =null;
        while((line = reader.readLine()) != null){

            String[] stringArr = line.split("\\s+");
            Set&lt;String&gt; strSet = new HashSet&lt;String&gt;();
            for(String tmpStr : stringArr){
                strSet.add(tmpStr);
            }
            unique.add(strSet);
        }       
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You may also consider using more robust filtration mechanism used also by <a href="http://kohanaframework.org/" rel="nofollow">Kohana</a> php framework which can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://svn.bitflux.ch/repos/public/popoon/trunk/classes/externalinput.php" rel="nofollow">http://svn.bitflux.ch/repos/public/popoon/trunk/classes/externalinput.php</a></p>

<p>obfuscating the filename is <em>never</em> enough -- you need to filter the POST data, yes. Assume it is not PayPal calling the script until you can prove it.</p>

<p>the sanitation looks OK -- if your code becomes quite long though, I would tend to sanitize it in two steps --the strip_tags and basic sanitation at the beginning, and the mysql escaping at the same time you contact the database -- it makes it easier to maintain IMO.</p>

<p>My site is completely custom, as such I like to know when I have poorly written code. I use set_exception_handler and set_error_handler to use custom classes to log errors to a file. This includes notices and warnings.</p>

<p>Within my own code, this is fine as I get very few logs and those that I do get are things I actually want to fix.</p>

<p>However, i've just started using simplePie and because it's PHP4 compatible I get tons of notices, primarily for things like calling functions statically or passing things by reference incorrectly.</p>

<p>It's too much for me to go through and fix simplePie, if it wasn't I wouldn't be using it in the first place.</p>

<p>Is there a way that I can specifically ignore errors generated by a certain file or class? Here's an overview of what of my very basic exception handling looks like:</p>

<p>and here is an example of two of the errors simplePie throws up:</p>

<p><b>Sorry for the bad advice! Please disregard this post!</b> - keeping it undeleted, as it's generated some interesting discussion below</p>

<p>If no one should know its URL, the SQL-sanitize is probably not that big of an issue. Masking your IPN file should be enough unless someone hijacks your directory listing.</p>

<p><code>htmlentities()</code> will need to have an ENT_QUOTES flag to convert quotes.</p>

<p>if <code>get_magic_quotes_gpc()</code> is on, then <code>strip_slashes</code> are automatically done... in your case, it looks like you will double strip slashes. </p>

<p>also <code>mysql_real_escape_string</code> will do the work of <code>strip_slashes()</code> already ...</p>

<p>I think a way to do this could be to use a <code>TreeSet</code> where you put all the dictionary then use the method <code>subSet</code> to retreive all the words beginning by the desired letter and do a random on the subset.</p>

<p>But in my opinion the best way to do this, due to the quantity of data, would be to use a database with SQL requests instead of Java.</p>

<p>If you are using jQuery why are you still manipulating the DOM manually? Try cleaning your code. Also there are strange things in your success callback. What is this <code>t</code> variable? Once you are using it as element ID and also testing it's value for <code>eval</code>. By the way you should avoid using <code>eval</code>.</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    url: u,
    data: query,
    success: function(msg) {
        // This success callback needs revision
        if(t == ':eval') {
            // ??????
            eval(msg);
        }
        else {
            jQuery('#' + t).html(msg);
        }
    } 
});
</code></pre>

<p>I would probably replace all this with the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/load/" rel="nofollow"><code>.load()</code></a> function:</p>

<pre><code>$('#' + t).load(u, query);
</code></pre>

<p>I try to send an image over bluetooth to another device. This works mostly fine, but sometimes, I get a <code>StreamCorruptedException: Wrong format: 0x27</code> on the receiving device. Anybody knows what this means? And how can I avoid that?</p>

<p>Not that I know of, but you can use <code>"\r\n"</code>;</p>

<p>EDIT:<br/>
Credits to @sAc, but updated to actual replace the value &amp; better regexp:</p>

<pre><code>jQuery.fn.nl2br = function(){
    return this.each(function(){
        var that = jQuery(this);
        that.val(that.val().replace(/(&lt;br\s*\/?&gt;)|(&lt;p&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;)/gi, "\r\n"));
    });
};
jQuery("textarea").nl2br();
</code></pre>

<p>I don't have an example but I can provide you an idea.</p>

<li>Build a list of images in an array</li>

<p>Hey Guys, I'm trying to generate a bitmap off a WPF border. The whole thing sits in a asp.net app (server side of course) running .net 4.0.</p>

<p>The problem is, that the generated image is, well, empty. Does anyone have an idea why?</p>

<p>Here's the code.</p>

<pre><code>public static byte[] Draw(int width, int height)
    {
        MemoryStream memoryStream
            = new MemoryStream();
        Thread t = new Thread(delegate()
            {
                System.Windows.Controls.Border border = new System.Windows.Controls.Border()
                {
                    Background = Brushes.Red,
                    BorderBrush = Brushes.Green,
                    CornerRadius = new System.Windows.CornerRadius(5),
                    Width = width,
                    Height = height
                };

                border.ApplyTemplate();

                RenderTargetBitmap renderTargetBitmap = 
                    new RenderTargetBitmap(width, height, 90, 90, PixelFormats.Pbgra32);

                renderTargetBitmap.Render(border);

                BitmapEncoder bitmapEncoder = 
                    new PngBitmapEncoder();

                bitmapEncoder.Frames.Add(BitmapFrame.Create(renderTargetBitmap));
                bitmapEncoder.Save(memoryStream);
            });
        t.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);
        t.Start();
        bool success = t.Join(5000);

        if (success)
            return memoryStream.ToArray();
        else
            throw new Exception("Fail");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The result is quite bad, as I said the thing returns the image with the right width and height, but it's empty, so I guess I don't mess the thing up with the threading bit.</p>

<p>Well, say you were getting a <code>SEL</code> from somewhere else, and you just wanted to execute it, you'd use this method.</p>

<p>Otherwise, yeah, you'd usually want to use the first example.</p>

<p>really nice.

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>performSelector:</code> method is equivalent to sending an aSelector message directly to the receiver. For example, all three of the following messages do the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>id myClone = [anObject copy];
id myClone = [anObject performSelector:@selector(copy)];
id myClone = [anObject performSelector:sel_getUid("copy")];
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, the <code>performSelector:</code> method allows you to send messages that aren’t determined until runtime. A variable selector can be passed as the argument:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>SEL myMethod = findTheAppropriateSelectorForTheCurrentSituation();
[anObject performSelector:myMethod];
</code></pre>

<p>You have to combine some things. First you need an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ImageView.html" rel="nofollow">ImageView</a> in order to display an image on the Android phone.</p>

<p>Then I would take a look into a random number generator (e.g. <a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Random.html" rel="nofollow">http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Random.html</a>) so that you can get a random number.</p>

<p>By combining these to things, you can randomly select a picture from a list of available pictures and display it using the ImageView.</p>

<p>hi my dear friends:</p>

<p>i am looking for a way for overlapping a table on another , but with a condition.</p>

<p>when u change the browser's size or u change the screen resolution so every positioning should be fine.</p>

<p>i test absolute positioning (z-index and top and left) but when u change the browser's size or u change the screen resolution the absolute positioning table loses my favorite position into other static table.</p>

<p>i test relative positioning (z-index and top and left) and when u change the browser's size or u change the screen resolution every thing is fine but we have reserved space for relative table.how can i remove that?</p>

<p>thanks in future advance</p>

<p>When I do a find query from the mongodb JavaScript console, I get a beautiful JSON response. However, when I do a find with the ruby driver, it stores the JSON as some Ruby object. How do I convert this back to JSON? Or, better yet, how do I just get the JSON without doing the extra conversions?</p>

<p>You have to remove these errors.<br>
1. Remove &amp; in assignments like $foo <b>=&amp;</b> new Object()<br>
2. You can't access method in statticly way if it's not a static method so instead <b>Object::method()</b> you should try using <b>Object->method()</b> or try to change <b>function method()</b> to <b>static function method()</b></p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>

<p>I currently am translating/transforming my UIView. I need to prevent a UIView from going out, e.g. prevent users from seeing the background behind when they drag the UIView. Something like the bounces when you go out of bounds in UIScrollView implements would be nice. Unfortunately I can't use a UIScrollView because I need to do custom drawing in that UIView. Anyone can help out here? Thanks.</p>

<p>I am trying to download a zip file using HttpCLient 4 and it is going at around .5 (kilobytes/kilobits)? per minute. The file is less than a MB large, and the download will probably take an hour! Am I doing something wrong? How else should I do this? Here is my current implementation:</p>

<p>Hi,
I am developing an iPhone app using cocos2d and box2d.In this app i require to set a timer.
The timer will show the remaining time in hand of an player to reach destination...</p>

<p>how can i do that.....i have drawn a scene but no sure as i am beginner how to add timer..</p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>I've written this code for a friend. The idea is he can add a "default" class to his textboxes, so that the default value will be grayed out, and then when he clicks it, it'll disappear, the text will return to its normal color, and then clicking a second time won't clear it:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    var textbox_click_handler = function clear_textbox() {
        $(this).removeClass('default');
        $(this).attr('value', '');
        $(this).unbind(textbox_click_handler);
    };

    $(".default").mouseup(textbox_click_handler);

});
</code></pre>

<p>The clicking-to-clear works, but I get the following error:</p>

<pre>
Uncaught TypeError: Object function clear_textbox() { ... } has no method 'split'
</pre>

<p>what is causing this? How can I fix it? I would just add an anonymous function in the mouseup event, but I'm not sure how I would then unbind it -- I could just unbind everything, but I don't know if he'll want to add more functionality to it (probably not, but hey, he might want a little popup message to appear when certain textboxes are clicked, or something).</p>

<p>How can I fix it? What is the 'split' method for? I'm guessing it has to do with the <code>unbind</code> function, since the clearing works, but clicking a second time still clears it.</p>

<p>I'm looking into control extenders which seems like it could be promising but I cannot find many examples of doing anything but AJAX stuff with it.</p>

<p>I created the LocalConnection variable within the init() scope, so when the function ended the localconnection was destroyed. the solution is just to declare the variable outside of the init function.</p>

<pre><code>public var a:LocalConnection;

private function init():void {
        a = new LocalConnection();
        a.client=this;
        a.connect("abcde");
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Was this issue solved then ? Are you able to select only one video or image or you can select multiple video or image items ?</p>

<p>Make sure you are <a href="http://api.jquery.com/unbind/" rel="nofollow">unbinding</a> <code>mouseup</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function clear_textbox() {
    $(this).removeClass('default');
    $(this).attr('value', '');
    $(this).unbind('mouseup');
}

$(function() {
    $('.default').mouseup(clear_textbox);
});
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Also I would write this as a <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring" rel="nofollow">plugin form</a>:</p>

<pre><code>(function($) {
    $.fn.watermark = function(settings) {
        this.each(function() {
            $(this).css('color', 'gray');
            $(this).mouseup(function() {
                var $this = $(this);
                $this.attr('value', '');
                $this.unbind('mouseup');
            });
        });
        return this;
   };
})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p>so that your friend can simply:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $('.someClassYourFriendUses').watermark();
});
</code></pre>

<p>If I were you, I would stay away from Rmagick/Imagemagick. I had a similar need in my rails application, to show the activity of user as a graph. I tried and failed to get both Gruff/Scruffy working, both depend on Rmagick. I finally gave up and used jQuery/Flot and it produces beautiful graphs. </p>

<p>I have to admit doing this to POCOs and have found it very productive. Other common uses</p>

<ul>
<li>Fullname = FirstName + " " + Surname</li>
<li>CostIncl = Excl + Tax</li>
<li>Sometimes can also aggregate totals in child entities (e.g. InvoiceTotal = Sum of all LineItem.Totals)</li>
</ul>

<p>etc</p>

<p>There are some caveats</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are sending these entities directly across the wire (e.g. WCF or ASMX), ensure they aren't marked as Serializable / DataMember, as they will fail serialization without a setter</li>
<li>And if you aren't (e.g. mapping them across the wire or for MVVM purposes) you will need to duplicate the effort</li>
<li>Edit : As per Stephen's comment, using a derived property in a LINQ query (which hits SQL) will fail (since it can't be mapped to SQL).</li>
</ul>

<p>Hi can somebody help me with the matlab command here. I've got to determine the highest point in a filled contour i've plotted using matrix data in a file. And then i have to mark the highest point with a red 'x'.</p>

<pre><code>load('0101862_mod.dtm')   % loading the dtm file
X = X0101862_mod(1:81,:)  % we name X0101862, it is the location where the data X, Y and Z is stored
Y = X0101862_mod(82:162,:)
Z = X0101862_mod (163:243,:)

figure (1)
subplot(2,2,3)
[C,h] = contourf(X,Y,Z,10);
xlabel('x'); ylabel('y'); zlabel('z'); title('X0101862_mod');
view(-73,34); axis equal; colormap summer; colorbar;
</code></pre>

<p>i know it involves 'max' command. Kept getting error when i use max.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a way that I can specifically ignore errors generated by a certain file or class?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should be easy! You could check in your custom error handler</p>

<pre><code>function customErrorHandler($errno, $errstr, $errfile, $errline)
</code></pre>

<p>whether <code>$errfile</code> is in one of the simplePie files, and in that case <code>return true;</code> silently.</p>

<p>For some reason my textarea DIV is not inheriting </p>

<pre><code>margin: 0 auto
</code></pre>

<p>from its parent:</p>

<pre><code>*
{
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a link to my <a href="http://gist.github.com/503132" rel="nofollow">CSS &amp; HTML for this example</a></p>

<p>How can I make it so that the textarea DIV actually gets centered?</p>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I am not sure if this is really different but try assigning the function to a variable: </p>

<pre><code>var c = function clear_textbox() {
    $(this).removeClass('default');
    $(this).attr('value', '');
    $(this).unbind('mouseup');
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then: </p>

<pre><code>$(".default").mouseup(function(){
   c();
});
</code></pre>

<p>You could inspect the $errfile parameter passed to your error handler to see if the error originates from somewhere inside simplePie.
Documentation: <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php</a></p>

<p>You need to open the file with both input and output attributes.<br>
The following code doesn't have the usual error handling, it is just to illustrate a technique.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;

int main()
{
    const char *szFname = "c:\\tmp\\tmp.txt";
    std::fstream fs(szFname, 
                    std::fstream::binary | 
                    std::fstream::in     | 
                    std::fstream::out);
    fs.seekp(13, std::fstream::beg);
    fs &lt;&lt; "123456789";

    return 0;
}

<p>Instance variables in Objective-C are by default private (like in java: private int) so, you need accessors (getters/setters) to get and set the instance variable. So, @property tells the compiler to automatically generate those getters/setters for your instance variable, you can specify some options to it like:</p>

<pre><code>@property (readonly) UILabel *labelName;
</code></pre>

<p>Which will make the compiler generate just a getter without a setter for this property. So, basically the @property keyword tells the compiler to generate getter/setter based on options you provide.</p>

<p>The @synthesize keyword will complete the implementation of @property and generate the getter/setter for you. This is required because anything written in the header (.h) file has to be reflected on the implementation file (.m). So, @property for the .h and @synthesize for the .m.</p>

<p>Here is an example (.h file)</p>

<pre><code>@interface QuickStartViewController : UIViewController 
{    
    NSString* name;
}
@property (retain) NSString *name;
</code></pre>

<p>(.m) file</p>

<pre><code>@implementation QuickStartViewController

@synthesize name;
</code></pre>

<p>Add <code>display:block;</code> to textarea style. After that textarea will be treated as block element and will be displayed centered.</p>

<pre><code>textarea
{
    display:block;
        resize: none;
    overflow: hidden;
    width: 460px;
    padding: 3px;   
}
</code></pre>

<p>By default, margins are not inherited. You need to specifiy <code>margin: 0 auto;</code> explicitly for the textarea in question. Otherwise, the containing element will be centered, but the textarea will be laid out inside the container according to the regular flow (ie., <code>margin: 0;</code>).</p>

<p>You could utilise mod_rewrite.</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^blog/index\.php/weblog/rss_2\.0/$ /feed/ [R=302]

<p>Now, find a closed formula for the first number that cannot be put in a box (or, if you prefer, the highest number that can be put into a box, before no other number can be added).</p>

<p>I would like to create application for Windows Phone 7, which will be communicating with desktop application via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi. Is there any API in Silverlight, which allows to use Bluetooth/Wi-Fi programatically?</p>

<p>When I have control over the style guides, everything is defined as a <code>struct</code>.  Historically, I wanted all my objects to be one or the other, since I was taught it was undefined behavior to forward declared a struct as a class, and vice versa (I'm not sure if this was ever actually true, its just what I was told).  And really, <code>struct</code> has the more reasonable default state.</p>

<p>I still do the same because I've never been convinced of the value of using it as a form of documentation.  If you need to convey that an object only has public members, or doesn't have any member functions, or whatever arbitrary line you chose to draw between the two, you have <em>actual</em> documentation available for that.  Since you never actually <em>use</em> the <code>struct</code> or <code>class</code> keyword when using the type, you would need to go hunting for the definition anyhow if you want the information.  And with everybody having their own opinion on what <code>struct</code> actually means, its usefulness as self-documentation is reduced. So I shoot for consistency: everything as one or the other.  In this case, <code>struct</code>.</p>

<p>Its not a popular way of doing things, to say the least.  Fortunately for everybody involved, I very rarely have control over the coding standards.</p>

<p>What I usually do is maintain multiple configuration files in the repository, but not under the actual name (e.g. in a dedicated folder that gets excluded from deployment). My deployment scripts then copy the appropriate config file into the final location. So my deployment routine goes:</p>

<ul>
<li>checkout</li>
<li>compile</li>
<li>run deployment script</li>
</ul>

<p>how to change the title of page through jquery?</p>

<ul>
<li>MarkupExtension</li>

<li>Grid.IsSharedSizeScope / SharedSizeGroup</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are not supported in Silverlight and you have to workaround them.
Every case needs it's own judgment about how to "fill the gaps"</p>

<p>For the triggers part, the only solution is to use VisualStateManger.
The following article gives a good example of how to make the transition from triggers to VSM: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/wpfsdk/archive/2009/02/27/the-visualstatemanager-and-triggers.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/wpfsdk/archive/2009/02/27/the-visualstatemanager-and-triggers.aspx</a></p>

<p>Next, OnApplyTemplate is fired in different order, which might affect any Custom Controls or UserControls you might have created.</p>

<p><strong>WPF:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>UserControl Constructor</li>
<li>MyControl Constructor</li>
<li><em><strong>MyControl.OnApplyTemplate</em></strong></li>
<li>UserControl Loaded</li>
<li>MyControl Loaded</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Silverlight:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>UserControl Constructor</li>
<li>MyControl Constructor</li>
<li>MyControl Loaded</li>
<li>UserControl Loaded</li>
<li><em><strong>MyControl.OnApplyTemplate</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>And of course Microsoft has an article about that, called "WPF Compatibility" and gives a more thorough overview about the differences and changes between WPF and Silverlight:</p>

<p>Dose windows mobile 6 SDK support sqlserverce database operations into MFC smart device application?
I can create database on sqlserverce using COM components, but I dont want to use it instead will prefer windows mobile 6 SDK.
Is it possible?</p>

<p>Check this website: <a href="http://moulon.inra.fr/ruby/plruby.html" rel="nofollow">http://moulon.inra.fr/ruby/plruby.html</a> , it has some nice examples.</p>

<p>if you don't want to completely unbind mouseup, check for the current state using hasClass(). No need to unbind anything.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

    $('.default').bind('mouseup', function(e) {
        var tb = $(this);
        if(tb.hasClass('default')) {
            tb.removeClass('default').val('');
        }
    });

});
</code></pre>

<p>Step #1: Do not call <code>publishProgress()</code> for every byte.</p>

<p>Step #2: Read more than a byte at a time. Better yet, don't use the <code>InputStream</code> directly -- use <code>HttpEntity#writeTo()</code> to have <code>HttpClient</code> write your data to the output file.</p>

<p>I can give you two solutions. </p>

<p>The first is to make a standard render-to-texture, but with a cubemap attached as the destination buffer. If your hardware is recent enough, it can be done in a single pass. This will deal with all the needed math in HW for you, but data repartition of cubemaps aren't ideal (quite a lot of distortion if the corners). In most cases, it should be enough though.</p>

<p>After this, you render a quad to the screen, and in a shader you map your UV coordinates to xyz vectors using staightforwad spherical mapping. The HW will compute for you which side of the cubemap to take, at which UV.</p>

<p>The second is more or less the same, but with a custom deformation and less HW support : <a href="http://graphicsrunner.blogspot.com/2008/07/dual-paraboloid-reflections.html" rel="nofollow">dual paraboloids</a>. Two paraboloids may not be enough, but you are free to slightly modify the equations and make 6 passes. The rendering pass is the same, but this time you're all by yourself to choose the right texture and compute the UVs.</p>

<p>In pure JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>document.title = "Insert title here";
</code></pre>

<p>the document should be fully loaded before you change it.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Document.title" rel="nofollow">Document.Title</a> at Mozilla Developer Central</p>

<pre><code>$('title').html('newTitle')
</code></pre>

<p>I recommend to take a look to this apple docs: This is the old and classic way, properties just simplifies things but if you are new to Obj-C it can be confusing.
They are just not accessors, the important part are the "copy", "retain", "assign", "readonly", etc
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/ocProperties.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/ocProperties.html</a></p>

<p>Another reason that is not written here is that: when you get serious, you can implement Key-Value Observing, Key-Value coding, etc, like in CoreAnimation, Notifications, etc.</p>

<p>And I admit it to, I just take a look to your profile, lol.</p>

<p>Like any other page element:</p>

<pre><code> $("title").html("your new title");
</code></pre>

<p>I've solved it (or someone else solved it for me) so I thought I'd share with you:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Return NO from the delegate method
  gestureRecognizer:shouldReceiveTouch:
  if touch.view is one of your buttons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you can't. Just install PostgreSQL on your (virtual) system and install PL/Ruby as well:
<a href="http://moulon.inra.fr/ruby/plruby.html" rel="nofollow">http://moulon.inra.fr/ruby/plruby.html</a></p>

<p>Setting up a virtual machine (in VMware or Virtual Box) using Ubuntu with PostgreSQL, takes just a few minutes:

<p>Why jQuery for such minor task? Use vanilla javascript:</p>

<pre><code>document.title = "My new title";
</code></pre>

<p>If you still want to go with jQuery, you simply do:</p>

<pre><code>$("title").html("My new title");
</code></pre>

<p>Silverlight forces you to make some changes to your design patterns, which, if is pervasive throughout your software, can render code reuse quite moot.</p>

<p>For instance, data template selectors are missing -- I found this to be quite a shock.</p>

<p>I'm working on an application which interacts with hundreds of devices across a network. The type of work being committed requires a lot of the concurrent threads (mostly because each of them requires network interaction and does so separately, but for other reasons as well). At the moment, we're in the area of requiring about 20-30 threads per device being interacted with.</p>

<p>A simple calculation puts this at thousands of threads, even up to 10,000 threads. If we put aside the CPU penalty for thread-switching, etc., how many threads can Java 5 running on CentOS 64-bit handle? Is this just a matter of RAM or is there anything else we should consider?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>May be the server ignore the packets of icmp,It may be the reason for the problem of 'ping'.</p>

<p>Has the server started the service of telnet?
you may try the command below to check the service port using tcp protocol.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm programming an invoice script. I'm looking for a php script that convert number to letter. Exemple, the invoice show this value : 155€</p>

<p>The script put automatically: ONE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE</p>

<p>Any ideas ?</p>

<p>N.B: I find some script but i want one that support <strong><em>FRENCH</em></strong> letters.</p>

<p>Thank you :)</p>

<p>Hi GTD,</p>

<p>Looks like bluetooth is going to be standard in the chassis spec. Unfortunately at this stage there is no api exposing Bluetooth functionality in the SDK. I think we'll have to wait and see on this one.</p>

<p>I understand devices will be able to inherently connect over wifi the same as 3g. No low level wifi specific api's known at this stage.</p>

<p>You can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>var textbox_click_handler = function(e) {
    $(this).removeClass('default')
        .attr('value', '')
        .unbind(e.type, arguments.callee);
};
$(function() {
    $(".default").mouseup(textbox_click_handler);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Or use the <code>.one</code> function instead that automatically unbinds the event:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $(".default").one('mouseup', function() {
        $(this).removeClass('default').attr('value', '');
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Imagine we have N devices (say, mobile phones) with WiFi somewhere in a big desert (no area WiFi, no routers, no GSM signal, etc). Is it techincally possible to create dynamical network of such devices, so that they automatically discower new nodes and everyone can send messages to everyone (let us take simplest case - no broadcasting of messages, contacting devices should be in direct WiFi visibility to each other)?</p>

<p>Is it any java framework (SE or ME) exists ?</p>

<p>I've checked the document:</p>

<p><a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AS3LCR/Flash_10.0/flash/media/Camera.html" rel="nofollow">http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AS3LCR/Flash_10.0/flash/media/Camera.html</a></p>

<p>But still don't find info on how to control the visual affect(like lightness, saturation and so on) of my pc camera.</p>

<p>Is that kind of job possible with actionscript?</p>

<p>Only problem with your code I see is That DeleteDup doesn't have return type specified.
Otherwise code looks fine and reads from file properly.</p>

<p>Please post deleteDuplicates method code and file used. </p>

<p>i am going to build a web based application using j2ee. can you please suggest me some ideas about what to do?</p>

<p>What I understood from your question is to print the lines which do not have duplicate words in the line.<br>
May be you could try the following snippet for it.</p>

<pre><code>public void deleteDup(File f) 
    {
        try 
        {
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(f));
            Integer wordCount = 0;
            boolean isDuplicate = false;
            String [] arr = null;
            for (String line = null; (line = in.readLine()) != null;) 
            {
                isDuplicate = false;
                wordCount = 0;
                wordMap.clear();

                arr = line.split("\\s+");
                for(String word : arr)
                {
                    wordCount = wordMap.get(word);
                    if(null == wordCount)
                    {
                        wordCount = 1;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        wordCount++;
                        isDuplicate = true;
                        break;
                    }
                    wordMap.put(word, wordCount);
                }
                if(!isDuplicate)
                {
                    lines.add(line);
                }
            }
        }
        catch(IOException e) 
        {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; wordMap = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;();
    private List&lt;String&gt; lines = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>In this snippet, <strong>lines</strong> will contain the lines which do not have duplicate words in it.
It would have been easier to find your problem if we knew what </p>

<pre><code>this.deleteDuplicates(line);
</code></pre>

<p>tries to do. Maybe it is not clearing any of the data structure used. Hence, the words checked in previous lines will be checked for other lines too though they are not present.</p>

<p>Assuming you're using the latest jQuery, doing something as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>$('title').text('My new title');
</code></pre>

<p>should work. At least, this works doing a simple in-page javascript console test in google Chrome. You could use .html instead of .text, but generally you don't want HTML in the title tag, since that's not usually allowed and might display weirdly - with .text at least you know your new title string will be escaped and not lead to any weird behaviour.</p>

<p>Otherwise I expect doing something using straight javascript would be fine, such as:</p>

<pre><code>document.title = 'A new title';
</code></pre>

<p>An <code>UPDATE...JOIN</code> is an alternative to the <code>EXISTS</code> answer provided by <em>tuffkid</em> and <em>Brian Hooper</em>.  I've tested both, and they both take the same time (2.52 seconds on my computer):</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE table_one
JOIN table_two
  ON table_one.id = table_two.other_id
SET this=0
  WHERE table_one.this=1;
</code></pre>

<p>The joined columns should be indexed, and if <code>table_two.other_id</code> has a <code>UNIQUE</code> index, the query should run very fast.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p>Create tables:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `table_one` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `this` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `this` (`this`)
);

CREATE TABLE `table_two` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `other_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `other_id` (`other_id`)
);
</code></pre>

<p>Insert some test data:</p>

<pre><code>DELIMITER //
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS populate//
CREATE PROCEDURE populate()
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 0;
    WHILE i &lt; 550000 DO
        INSERT INTO table_one (this) VALUES ((i MOD 18)+1);
        IF i MOD 18 = 0 THEN
            INSERT INTO table_two (other_id) VALUES (i+1);
        END IF;
        SET i = i + 1;
    END WHILE;
END;
//
DELIMITER ;

<p>Run the update:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE table_one

<p>Thread pools address two different problems: they usually provide improved performance when executing large numbers of asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead, and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources, including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks. Each ThreadPoolExecutor also maintains some basic statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.</p>

<p>ThreadPoolExecutor is class you should be using.</p>

<p>To convert to French with <code>Numbers_Words</code>, you do:</p>

<pre><code>// include class
include("Numbers/Words.php");

// create object
$nw = new Numbers_Words();

// convert to string
echo "3000000 in words is " . $nw-&gt;toWords(3000000, 'fr');

<p>You don't explicitly set the zoom level for <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKMapView_Class/MKMapView/MKMapView.html" rel="nofollow">MKMapView</a>, instead you set a visible <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKMapView_Class/MKMapView/MKMapView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/MKMapView/setRegion%3aanimated%3a" rel="nofollow">region</a> with a <em>MKCoordinateRegion</em> that includes a center point and the span of coordinates to display.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>By default on Windows, when copying text, it gets put in the clipboard. But when attempting to copy <em>empty</em> text, the clipboard is untouched. For example, selecting no text in your editor, then hitting <code>ctrl+c</code>, will cause no change in the clipboard.</p>

<p>Problem is, I need to catch this event with AutoHotKey. Since the clipboard is unchanged, I have no idea how to do this cleanly (without a timeout, that is).</p>

<p>Does anyone have any idea how to do this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify, I'm sending the ctrl+c from within AutoHotKey. I'm doing so to tell if any text is selected, i.e., I'm sending ctrl+c, then checking if any text was copied to the clipboard or not. Problem is, if no text is selected, the clipboard handlers for AutoHotKey never get called, forcing me to use a timeout, which isn't good practice.</p>

<p><del>As of Aug 1 2010, there are still no methods for notifications in the new Graph API (I'm not sure if there are any plans for migrating that). You need to use the old REST API for that.</del></p>

<p>Use FB.api in place of old REST API. It could be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>FB.api(
  {
    method: 'notifications.get'
  },
  function(response) {
    alert("Number of unread messages: " + response.messages.unread);
  }
);
</code></pre>

<p>The first sends a message to an object and so does the second.  In almost all cases, you should use the first.  It's quicker and clearer.  However, the second has its uses.  For instance, you can use it in a situation where you would need to supply a call back.</p>

<p>Another powerful use is in combination with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Miscellaneous/Foundation_Functions/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000055-BCIEICGB" rel="nofollow">NSSelectorFromString()</a>.  You can literally decide what message to use at run time based on a string in a configuration file or from user input (don't forget to validate it!).  You can even build selector names using NSString -stringWithFormat: etc.  For instance, <a href="http://parsekit.com/grammars.html" rel="nofollow">this parser kit</a> uses the technique to inform the program when parser rules have been matched.</p>

<p>If you want to take a chunk of html and replace <br /> tags and self-closing  tags with newline characters, doing something like:</p>

<p>should return a string of the container's HTML with those tags replaced with newline characters.</p>

<p>Greet Everybody
I have some problems about iptables rules under Ubuntu .</p>

<p>I create a simple firewall with the function of NAT,then restart the server.
the command to create:</p>

<pre><code>iptables -F
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
</code></pre>

<p>type commands below in the terminal:</p>

<pre><code>iptables -L -v
</code></pre>

<p>But display no rules.
And it seemd that the NAT function and the rules made last time are still available to use.</p>

<p>Is it necessary to create some script to save the rules .
Will the rules got lost when I restart the server.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I am trying to bring up the HTTP authentication box for handling my login. However, I want to communicate to my database through Ajax. But I dont know how to connect the HTTP authentication box with AJAX.</p>

<p>Any Idea, how to do this? Please also include example</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is to generate some random numbers (not necessarily single digit) like</p>

<pre><code>29106
7438
5646
4487
9374
28671
92
13941
25226
10076
</code></pre>

<p>and then count the number of digits I get:</p>

<pre><code>count[0] =       3  Percentage =  6.82
count[1] =       5  Percentage = 11.36
count[2] =       6  Percentage = 13.64
count[3] =       3  Percentage =  6.82
count[4] =       6  Percentage = 13.64
count[5] =       2  Percentage =  4.55
count[6] =       7  Percentage = 15.91
count[7] =       5  Percentage = 11.36
count[8] =       3  Percentage =  6.82
count[9] =       4  Percentage =  9.09
</code></pre>

<p>This is the code I am using:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main() {

    int i;
    srand(time(NULL));
    FILE* fp = fopen("random.txt", "w");    
    // for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
    for(i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++)
        fprintf(fp, "%d\n", rand());
    fclose(fp);

    int dummy;
    long count[10] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};
    fp = fopen("random.txt", "r");
    while(!feof(fp)) {
        fscanf(fp, "%1d", &amp;dummy);
        count[dummy]++;                 
    }
    fclose(fp);

    long sum = 0;
    for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        sum += count[i];

    for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
        printf("count[%d] = %7ld  Percentage = %5.2f\n",
            i, count[i], ((float)(100 * count[i])/sum));

}
</code></pre>

<p>If I generate a large number of random numbers (1000000), this is the result I get:</p>

<pre><code>count[0] =  387432  Percentage =  8.31
count[1] =  728339  Percentage = 15.63
count[2] =  720880  Percentage = 15.47
count[3] =  475982  Percentage = 10.21
count[4] =  392678  Percentage =  8.43
count[5] =  392683  Percentage =  8.43
count[6] =  392456  Percentage =  8.42
count[7] =  391599  Percentage =  8.40
count[8] =  388795  Percentage =  8.34
count[9] =  389501  Percentage =  8.36
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that 1, 2 and 3 have too many hits. I have tried running this several times and each time I get very similar results.</p>

<p>I am trying to understand what could cause 1, 2 and 3 to appear much more frequently than any other digit.</p>

<hr>

<p>Taking hint from what Matt Joiner and Pascal Cuoq pointed out,</p>

<p>I changed the code to use</p>

<pre><code>for(i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++)
    fprintf(fp, "%04d\n", rand() % 10000);
// pretty prints 0
// generates numbers in range 0000 to 9999
</code></pre>

<p>and this is what I get (similar results on multiple runs):</p>

<pre><code>count[0] =  422947  Percentage = 10.57
count[1] =  423222  Percentage = 10.58
count[2] =  414699  Percentage = 10.37
count[3] =  391604  Percentage =  9.79
count[4] =  392640  Percentage =  9.82
count[5] =  392928  Percentage =  9.82
count[6] =  392737  Percentage =  9.82
count[7] =  392634  Percentage =  9.82
count[8] =  388238  Percentage =  9.71
count[9] =  388352  Percentage =  9.71
</code></pre>

<p>What can be the reason that 0, 1 and 2 are favored?</p>

<p>I tried to do the same with a 3x200 table, and get the same result. One function in the table-narrow-cell implementation (table--vertical-cell-list) is recursive, and it looks like when the table is large enough, it blows up. I tried increasing the value of <code>max-specpdl-size</code> (see documentation at the end of <a href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/elisp-manual-21/elisp_141.html" rel="nofollow">Section 11.3 of GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</a>), but it made no difference.</p>

<p>Will org-mode tables be good enough for your purposes instead?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: I made a typo in the variable name when trying to modify the variable's value. Chaging the <code>max-specpdl-size</code> to 10000, I was able to use the function. If this is not an operation you are expecting to do very often, you can change it on the fly: <code>M-:</code>, <code>(setq max-specpdl-size 10000)</code>, resize table. Alternatively, you can find a safe value, and add it to .emacs.</p>

<p>You can use this code if you want to replace the html-elements itself:</p>

<pre><code>$('body').find('br').replaceWith("\n");
$('body').find('p').each(function() {
    $(this).replaceWith("\n" + $(this).text() + "\n");
});

<p>Hi there,
Not sure if this question makes for some poor performance down the track, but seems to at least feel "a better way" right now..</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is this:</p>

<p>I have a table called CONTACTS which amongst other things has a primary key field called memberID</p>

<p>I also have an XML field which contains the ID's of your friends (for example).. like:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;root&gt;&lt;id&gt;2&lt;/id&gt;&lt;id&gt;6&lt;/id&gt;&lt;id&gt;14&lt;/id&gt;&lt;/root&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So what I am trying to do via a stored proc is pass in say your member ID, and return all of your friends info, for example:</p>

<pre><code>  select name, address, age, dob from contacts
  where id... xml join stuff...
</code></pre>

<p>The previous way I had it working (well sort of!) selected all the XML nodes (/root/id) into a temp table, and then did a join from that temp table to the contact table to get the contact fields...</p>

<p>Any help much appreciated.. just a bit overloaded from the .query .nodes examples, and of course which is maybe a better way of doing this...</p>

<p>THANKS IN ADVANCE!</p>

<p>&lt;-- EDIT -->
I did get something working, but looks like a SQL frankenstein statement!
Basically I needed to get the friends contact ID's from the XML field, and populate into a temp table like so:</p>

<pre><code>Declare @contactIDtable TABLE (ID int)
INSERT INTO @contactIDtable (ID)
        SELECT CONVERT(INT,CAST(T2.memID.query('.') AS varchar(100))) AS friendsID
        FROM dbo.members
        CROSS APPLY memberContacts.nodes('/root/id/text()') AS T2(memID)
</code></pre>

<p>But crikey! the convert/cast thing looks serious.. as I need to get an INT for the next bit which is the actual join to return the contact data as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT memberID, memberName, memberAddress1
    FROM members
    INNER JOIN @contactIDtable cid
    ON members.memberID = cid.ID
    ORDER BY memberName
</code></pre>

<p>RESULT...
Well it works.. in my case, my memberContacts XML field had 3 nodes (id's in this case), and the above query returned 3 rows of data (memberID, memberName, memberAddress1)... </p>

<p>The whole point of this of course was to try to save creating a many join table i.e. list of all my friends ID's... just not sure if the above actually makes this quicker and easier...</p>

<p>Anymore ideas / more efficient ways of trying to do this???</p>

<p>IMHO, if you're really keen on not reinventing the wheel, I'd suggest you learn at least one more language.</p>

<p>I was stubbornly glued to VB and VB.NET until it dawned on me that  vb and vb.net aren't the only language in the world. I therefore learned C# and my programming life has never been the same.</p>

<p>I can now write code in all those 3 languages and am hoping to learn another, probably c++ before the end of the year.</p>

<p>The good thing about  being multilingual is that you're never limited in resources; if you can't find code to something in one language, you could find it code in another language. Plus, it doesn't stop you from using your preferred language. </p>

<p>For your example given above, it appears that <code>RAND_MAX</code> is <code>32767</code>. This will place an unusually high frequency of <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> for the most significant digit for the values from <code>10000</code> to <code>32767</code>.

<p>if the MainWindow.xib that is generated automatically by Xcode has a view that loads another xib/nib view inside it, then why we use it ?</p>

<p>rand() implementations vary wildly. IIRC, linear congruential random generators tend to have less randomness in lower-order bits. Quoting from the linux rand() man page:</p>

<blockquote>
       The  versions  of rand() and srand() in the Linux C Library use the same random number generator as random(3) and srandom(3), so the lower-order bits should be as random as the higher-order  bits.   However, on  older  rand()  implementations, and on current implementations on different systems, the lower-order bits are much less random than the higher-order bits.  Do not use this function in applications intended to be portable when good randomness is needed.

<p>The two main differences between F# and Iron Python are:</p>

<ol>
<li>F# is statically typed, while Iron Python is not.</li>
<li>The foundation of F# is functional programming while the foundation of Iron Python is object-oriented programming.  (With both having good support for other-paradigms.) </li>
</ol>

<p>These are relatively major differences, and they directly lead to the main practical reasons to prefer one over the other.</p>

<p>As you said, Iron Python is slower than F# due to the lack of static typing.  In the Computer Language Benchmarks, Iron Python is 25x in the median, and 120x slower in the worst case.  So if runtime performance is a consideration, F# is likely preferable.<br>
<a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=ironpy&amp;lang2=fsharp" rel="nofollow">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&amp;lang=ironpy&amp;lang2=fsharp</a></p>

<p>Since both are .NET, each can use the libraries of the other with just a little work.  So I don't see this as a major issue, although I guess it's possible to use SciPy in IronPython, while it would be tedious from F#, and the corresponding best free library for F# isn't quite as good.</p>

<p>Functional programming can be a very powerful style, and allows F# to have some powerful features like workflows, including asynchronous workflows which are well supported by the F# libraries.  You could roughly emulate such things in Iron Python, but it wouldn't work quite as smoothly, in part because of lack of support in the libraries.</p>

<p>Object orientation is more familiar to many programmers, and they might prefer Python for that reason.</p>

<p>Static typing also allows an IDE to provide better support to programmers.  The type of each variable can be reported to the programmer (via hovering in VS), and feedback on errors can be given while the code is being edited.  As a university lecturer I can say that this immediate feedback is extremely useful to my students while they are learning F#.  This enables them to manage more complex programs than they could otherwise.</p>

<p>Dynamic typing sometimes allows small, simple programs to be written slightly more quickly.  If this is the only coding you'll be doing then Python may be preferable.  But, if there's a chance a program will grow into something larger, then I'd prefer F#.    </p>

<p>That's because you generate numbers between <code>0</code> and <code>RAND_MAX</code>. The generated numbers are evenly distributed (i.e. approx. same probability for each number), however, the digits 1,2,3 occur more often than others in this range. Try generating between <code>0</code> and <code>10</code>, where each digit occurs with the same probability and you'll get a nice distribution.</p>

<p>Let's assume I'm implementing a Winforms UI where all commands adhere to the following pattern:</p>

<pre><code>interface ICommand
{
    bool CanExecute { get; }
    void Execute();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Buttons or menu items that trigger such a command should have the following set-up:</p>

<ul>
<li>property <code>Enabled</code> is bound to the command's <code>CanExecute</code></li>
<li>event <code>Click</code> is linked to the command's <code>Execute</code> (through an intermediate event handler due to the differing method signatures)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>trouble with <code>CanExecute</code></strong> is, implementing <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> for it won't work here, as this property cannot be directly modified, but depends on other factors in the program which needn't be related to the command. And one shouldn't have to trigger the command's <code>PropertyChanged</code> event in completely unrelated parts of the program.</p>

<p>How do you let the data binding manager know when <code>CanExecute</code> has changed?</p>

<p>Here's a (purly fictional) example of my problem: </p>

<pre><code>bool CanExecute
{
    get
    {
        return User.LoggedInForAtLeastNMinutes(5);
        // how would you trigger data-binding updates for CanExecute? 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to have the UI constantly checking <code>CanExecute</code> (as if it were a volatile field), but AFAIK this is not how Winforms data binding works. Does anyone have a solution for this problem?</p>

<p>I'm working with some C/C++ code that runs on Win32 and also VxWorks. It uses <code>#ifdef WIN32</code> to switch to platform specific implementations. </p>

<p>I've been using the code on the iPhone and I want to update it and keep it as portable as possible, but I'm not sure what's the best practice. So far I've been using <code>#ifdef __APPLE__</code> blocks. </p>

<p>How do I define macros on a per-project, or per file level in a C project using autotools?</p>

<p>Presently I have this: <code>mount_cpfs_CPPFLAGS = -DFUSE_USE_VERSION=28</code>, but I'm not sure that this is the "portable" way to define a C macro.</p>

<p>The code given is correct. My problem when asking the question was a typo in my implementation.</p>

<p>shame on me</p>

<p>well... there is still a bit that could be improved on:</p>

<pre><code>more=Many.objects.filter(one=one)
for m in more
    m.one=None
    m.save()
#and finally:
one.delete()
</code></pre>

<p>can be written as:</p>

<pre><code>for m in one.many_set.all()
    m.one=None
    m.save()
one.delete()
</code></pre>

<p>which is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>one.many_set.clear()
one.delete()
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to serialize an instance of JS object from the Server-side to the Client side
(the object contains data members and functions)</p>

<p>I have a Javascript stack on both end, all my users use Chrome and My server side is a NodeJS impl..</p>

<p>how would I do it? It should be trivial as my server is a Javascript one..</p>

<p>You can't just specify the number of sections, you also have to tell the table view which cells are in which specific sections.</p>

<p>Depending on how you set up <code>-tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code>, you may only be returning table view cells for one section.</p>

<p>If you don't specify more than one section (via <code>indexPath.section</code>) when creating cells, then you will get an out-of-bounds error in <code>-numberOfSectionsInTableView:</code> if you return more than one section there.</p>

<p>You might post code for <code>-tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> so we can see what's going on there. But that would be the first place I would look.</p>

<p>You probably want to have a main loop. INT 33 AX=0003 doesn't block waiting for mouse input.</p>

<p>I'm trying to create a Makefile that has a target per <code>src/</code> subfolder so that it creates a static lib.<br>

lib%.a: $(patsubst %.cpp, %.o, $(wildcard src/%/*.cpp))
    $(AR) rcs $@ $^

<p>But this doesn't work, the target matching works, but the dependency tracking doesn't.<br>
If I just leave alone <code>src/%/*.cpp</code> that completes properly to the <code>.cpp</code> files in the proper dir, but the moment I try to use it inside string functions to convert the <code>.cpp</code> to <code>.o</code> the <code>%</code> does not work anymore.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it possible to make our site's
  content at least accessible in all
  conditions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it is. What makes HTML well designed for this is that the proper use of semantic mark-up means that you don't have to think about individually all those cases that you listed.</p>

<p>I find it useful to consider the most difficult cases. If the user has failing sight and hearing and needs or wants to <a href="http://mozbraille.mozdev.org/" rel="nofollow">use a Braille device to browse the web</a>, can they use your web site? If the user is quadriplegic and needs to navigate web pages using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sip-and-puff" rel="nofollow">sip-and-puff input device</a>, can they use your web site? In each case, does your web site provide them with the best experience that they are capable of receiving?</p>

<p>Cover those cases, add a few basics like ensuring adequate colour contrast, make your web site as functionally rich and attractive as you wish for your average users, and you should find that support for the cases you list can be left to the devices themselves to provide appropriate accessibility support.</p>

<p>Read, understand and use WCAG 2.0 and WAI-ARIA. You will gain a much better understanding of the techniques you need than by asking individual questions on SO.</p>

<p>(To my surprise) jQuery has built-in <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#~username" rel="nofollow">support</a> for supplying HTTP auth credentials:</p>

    username: "NAMENAMENAMENAMENAME",
    password: "PWPWPWPWPWPWPWPWPWPW",
    ...

<p>Or you can override the XMLHttpRequest object like in this example: <a href="http://dothow.blogspot.com/2009/05/http-basic-authentication-with-jquery.html" rel="nofollow">http://dothow.blogspot.com/2009/05/http-basic-authentication-with-jquery.html</a></p>

<p>I think up to 65k threads is OK with java, the only thing you need to consider is stack space - linux by default allocates 48k per thread/process as stack space, which is wasteful for java (which doesn't have stack-allocated objects, hence uses much less stack space). This will easily use 500 megs for 10k threads.</p>

<p>I am trying to use a memcpy for a size of 200K, and it stucks!!!</p>

<p>Both destb and source are allocated.</p>

<p>What could be the reason for this issue?</p>

<p>Hello.</p>

<p>Make sure you follow the scheme:</p>

<pre><code>$conditions = array("Post.title" =&gt; "This is a post");
//Example usage with a model:
$this-&gt;Post-&gt;find('first', array('conditions' =&gt; $conditions));
</code></pre>

<p>See that it is an array in an array.</p>

<p>Kind regards.</p>

<p>Edit1: BTW you can have a look into the "automagic" of cake e.g. the columns in a database named <code>created</code> or <code>modified</code> get autoupdated.</p>

<p>Edit2: maybe a <code>debug($this-&gt;params['named']['searchPublishedSince'])</code> reveals something.</p>

<p>Ok I solved this one, the problem was not in the code but in the fact that there was an additional div nested inside the parent 'slide' div. The function was firing off both of them and causing the mayhem.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Images and script hosted on the same account (one site).</p>

<p>We know direct link to each image:</p>

<pre><code>$image = "http://site.com/images/full-1091.jpg"

<p>How can we <strong>get the size of this file?</strong></p>

<p>Like:</p>

<pre><code>{ do something with $image and get $image_size }
echo $image_size;
</code></pre>

<p>Its better to format <code>$image_size</code> like "156,8 Kbytes" or "20,1 Mbytes".</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm using python's lxml to validate xmls against a schema. I have a schema with an element:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xs:element name="link-url" type="xs:anyURL"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and I test, for example, this (part of an) xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a link-url="server/path"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I would like this test to FAIL because the <code>link-url</code> doesn't start with <code>http://</code>. I tried switching <code>anyURI</code> to <code>anyURL</code> but this results in an exception - it's not a valid tag.</p>

<p>Is this possible with lxml? is it possible at all with schema validation?</p>

<p>The @property keyword and its related friends @synthesize and @dynamic provide a short hand method for declaring and defining accessor methods for object properties.</p>

<p>As an example, the following:</p>

<pre><code>//interface
@property (retain) id foo;

//implementation
@synthesize foo = fooIvar;
</code></pre>

<p>is more or less equivalent to </p>

<pre><code>//interface
-(id) foo;
-(void) setFoo: (id) newFoo;

//implementation
-(id) foo
{
    id ret;
    @synchronized(self)
    {
        ret = [[fooIvar retain] autorelease]; // don't return from inside the sync block to avoid spurious warning
    }
    return ret;
}
-(void) setFoo: (id) newFoo
{
    @synchronized(self)
    {
        [newFoo retain];
        [fooIVar release];
        fooIVar = newFoo;
    }
}        
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the above assumes automatic KVO notifications.</p>

<p>In the old days, before properties, you would have found yourself writing stuff like the above quite a lot.</p>

<p>I have a mysql table :</p>

<p>Can I search between two dates in mysql with varchar type?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I think it's not problem of relative position or absolute position. In order that 2 tables/divs could be overlapped, one should use negative margin. In order that the layout looks elastic when u change the browser's size or the screen resolution, you have to use % as the unit of width for the tables/divs. Here's an example</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="table1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="table2"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>CSS</strong></p>

<pre><code>.table1{width:80%; height:200px; background-color:#cfcfcf;margin: 0px auto;}  
.table2{width:60%; height:200px; background-color:#fffae4;margin:-20px auto 0;}
</code></pre>

<p>The other way is using relative top position to achieve the effect of overlapping. And then the position should be either relative or absolute but different math to calculate the value of the negative top position. It's easy to understand to use relative position.</p>

<p>Here's another CSS using relative position.</p>

<pre><code>.table1{position:relative; width:80%; height:200px;background-color:#cfcfcf;top:10px;margin:0 auto}  
    .table2{position:relative; width:60%; height:200px; background-color:#fffae4;top: -20px;margin:0 auto}
</code></pre>

<p>So the key is using % as the unit of width. You can have a test with other units on <a href="http://www.pagecolumn.com/3_col_generator.htm" rel="nofollow">this page</a>.</p>

<p>Review enumerable documentation and you will find such methods.</p>

<p>Thank you!I have got it!!!</p>

<p>Your application needs a <em>window</em> so the system can display it to you on the device screen. In the window are various <em>views</em> which represent different areas of your application that users can interact with. Views can either be entire user interfaces, or individual UI controls.</p>

<p>The main window interacts with your application delegate to handle events that your application receives through the views.</p>

<p>Use a <code>Timer</code> to constantly poll the <code>CanExecute</code> property. Raise the <code>PropertyChanged</code> event when the property changes.</p>

<p>If this is really an absolute requirement, you might wan't to have a look at a language that's specifically build to deal with this level of concurrent threads, such as erlang.</p>

<p>Whether or not an XML file ends in a newline <em>should</em> be irrelevant. </p>

<p>However, you can try to add a newline manually, with the equivalent of this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
  &lt;root&gt;
    &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="other/processing" /&gt;
  &lt;/root&gt;
  &lt;xsl:value-of select="'&amp;#xA;'" /&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If this does not work for your XSL processor (i.e. the newline gets trimmed), you should consider changing your successive processing chain to ignore the "missing" newline.</p>

<p>You could send it as JSON string. <a href="http://www.mattfreeman.co.uk/2010/03/nodejs-json-data-services-javascript-web-scraping-fu/" rel="nofollow">Here's an example</a>:</p>

<pre><code>response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'application/json'});
response.write(JSON.stringify(yourObject));
response.close();
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using Zend Studio to work on several PHP projects. Most of these projects include several external libraries. I've got these tucked away in a "libraries" directory within each project (using a public, application, libraries structure). The libraries are included using svn:externals - we made this choice so that it's easy to keep them up to date in a new branch, and the libraries will be included with a checkout so all unit tests can do their thing without any unexpected external dependencies.</p>

<p>My problem is that some of these libraries do some fairly funky stuff, and contain coding constructs that Zend Studio finds offensive. Things like invalid escape sequences in double-quotes strings, or dependencies on undefined functions (of course, after checking whether or not that function exists). </p>

<p>While in most cases I completely agree with Zend that it's in fact an error, these are things I cannot easily solve. While I'm all for open source, I don't feel like resolving a thousand or more escaping issues in Zend Framework. This is a problem, however, because the Errors view now has over 2.500 "warnings". About 12 of which are for my own code. They get completely swamped by the problems in the libraries, which greatly reduces the value of doing the analysis in the first place.</p>

<p>Is there a way to tell Zend Studio to ignore these libraries? Or is there something else I'm missing here?</p>

<p>You can't alter the actual Camera data (there is a difference between that and what I am describing further), but it's possible to do what you want easily, after attaching the Camera object to a Video object and using the variety of transformation filters and routines from other native ActionScript classes like <code>ColorTransform</code>, <code>DisplayObject.transform.colorTransform</code> and <code>DisplayObject.filters</code>, to alter what is displayed on the screen/memory, which, I believe, is probably what you want anyway.</p>

<p>To give you a real world usage example, you can adjust saturation of the camera data being displayed in your video with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>/// Desaturate displayed image completely
video.filters = [ new ColorMatrixFilter(saturation_filter_matrix(0)) ];
</code></pre>

<p>where I have defined the methods as:</p>

<pre><code>static inline var RWGT = 0.3086;
static inline var GWGT = 0.6094;
static inline var BWGT = 0.0820;

static public function brightness_filter_matrix(b: Float)
{
    return [    b, 0, 0, 0, 0,
                0, b, 0, 0, 0,
                0, 0, b, 0, 0,
                0, 0, 0, 1, 0 ];
}

static public function saturation_filter_matrix(s: Float)
{
    var b = (1 - s) * RWGT;
    var a = b + s;
    var d = (1 - s) * GWGT;
    var e = d + s;
    var g = (1 - s) * BWGT;
    var i = g + s;

    return [    a, d, g, 0, 0,
                b, e, g, 0, 0,
                b, d, i, 0, 0,
                0, 0, 0, 1, 0 ];
}

static public function contrast_filter_matrix(v: Float)
{
    v += 1;

    var r = v;
    var g = v;
    var b = v;

    return [    r, 0, 0, 0, 128 * (1 - r),
                0, g, 0, 0, 128 * (1 - g),
                0, 0, b, 0, 128 * (1 - b),
                0, 0, 0, 1, 0 ];
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also think that <code>transform.colorTransform</code> may be more efficient with doing the same job, somehow I have observed that filters tend to tax Adobe Flash Player to moderate to high degree, so be advised.</p>

<p>The implications of the fact that you cannot change actual camera input, are that when you publish your camera across network (to Flash Media Server for instance), no matter what effects you use to display the data in your own video object, the party playing the stream will see the original unaltered data. A "workaround" would be to announce to the receiving party the exact parameters you want them to apply to their video object that is playing the stream. Assuming they apply these parameters in the same way you do for your displayed camera image, they will see your camera image the way you see it.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The code is written in haXe, but the two languages are very similar. The changes you need to be aware of are (blatant advertisement for haXe follows :-) <code>Float</code> in haXe is <code>Number</code> in ActionScript 3 for example, and haXe uses type inference which makes it possible to omit variable types at will, letting haXe figure it out itself (when you add two <code>int</code>'s what do you get? On Flash platform, you always get an <code>int</code> as well.) Also AS3 does not have the concept of inlining (yet?) and so you must simply remove <code>inline</code> syntax from the code, that's all.</p>

<p>Hi, i have entity A that has-a B entity, and B has-a A with @OneToOne bidirectional association.</p>

<p>Now, when i findall A records, hibernate perform two queries with a left outer join on B, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>select a.id, a.id_b, a.field1, b.id, b.field1 from A as a, B as b left outer join b ON b.id=a.id_b;
select a.id, a.id_b, a.field1, b.id, b.field1 from A as a, B as b left outer join b ON b.id=a.id_b WHERE b.id=?
</code></pre>

<p>First query load A and B fields and it is ok, but why perform second query to reload A?
I think this query load the A content in B, but this A is obviusly the A that contains B... so its already loaded with first query, isn't true?</p>

<p><strong>-- EDIT --</strong></p>

<p>Entity A:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class A implements Serializable{
    // id and other ecc ecc
    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="id_b")
    B b;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Entity B:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class B implements Serializable{
    // id and other ecc ecc
    @OneToOne(mappedBy="b")
    A a;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the situation, and a findAll on A need two queries... why?</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>(function () {

var original = document.title;
var timeout;

window.flashTitle = function (newMsg, howManyTimes) {
    function step() {
        document.title = (document.title == original) ? newMsg : original;

        if (--howManyTimes &gt; 0) {
            timeout = setTimeout(step, 1000);
        };
    };

    howManyTimes = parseInt(howManyTimes);

    if (isNaN(howManyTimes)) {
        howManyTimes = 5;
    };

    clearTimeout(timeout);

    step();
};

window.cancelFlashTitle = function () {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    document.title = original;
};

}());
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>flashTitle("New Message from Matt Lunn");
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>flashTitle("New Message from John Smith", 10); // toggles it 10 times.

<p>You have here a interval trigger (every second) that translates cleanly to SimpleTrigger. What you need with it is a restriction to only allow it to run in specific time range (2:15 - 5:20). This you can achieve by using a calendar, more precisely a DailyCalendar. You can set daily calendar to have this time range and set the InvertTimeRange to true to include the range instead of default of excluding the range.</p>

<p>Read more about the calendars in <a href="http://quartznet.sourceforge.net/tutorial/lesson_4.html" rel="nofollow">the tutorial</a> and <a href="http://quartznet.sourceforge.net/apidoc/topic2203.html" rel="nofollow">DailyCalendar API documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Nope.
You have to change format to a proper one.   </p>

<p>Previous programmer used this because of ignorance. You have to correct his mistake. </p>

<p>Don't be afraid of some extra work. Actually it's part of every programmer's job. There is no code in the whole world, which is perfect forever. Constant code improving is called <code>refactoring</code> and take big part of every programmer's worktime. </p>

<p>There IS a way to do it, I've found it, but it's a lot of work and will require you to spoof a browser 100% (and you'll likely be breaking their terms of service)</p>

<li>assuming you have a username/password for a facebook account, go curl for the oauth/authenticate... page. Extract any cookies returned in the "Set-Cookie" header and then follow any "Location" headers (compiling cookies along the way).</li>
<li>scrape the login form, preserving all fields, and submit it (setting the referer and content-type headers, and inserting your email/pass) same cookie collection from (1) required</li>
<li>same as (2) but now you're going to need to POST the approval form acquired after (2) was submitted, set the Referer header with thr URL where the form was acquired.</li>
<li>follow the redirects until it sends you back to your site, and get the "code" parameter out of that URL</li>
<li>Exchange the code for an access_token at the oauth endpoint</li>
</ol>

<p>The main gotchas are cookie management and redirects. Basically, you MUST mimic a browser 100%. I think it's hackery but there is a way, it's just really hard!</p>

<p>But you should of course heed the advice given by the others here, and try to fix your predecessor's mistakes, if at all possible within time-constraints. This will become an issue at some point, due to the amount of casting going on.</p>

<p>I'm new to Jira and have big problem with creating tables inside my testing plan. Using pipes, double pipes, etc. to build the table markup is really time consuming.</p>

<p>So, I saw here, that actually there's a RTF editor with visual table building in Confluence (which should be used in JIRA right? ) : <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Working+with+Tables+in+the+Rich+Text+Editor" rel="nofollow">http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Working+with+Tables+in+the+Rich+Text+Editor</a></p>

<p>However the textareas in my Jira installation are just plain text fields and can't figure out how to turn them into the the nice RTF areas shown in the URL above... </p>

<p>I downloaded the Nokia Symbian-3 SDK 0.8 - the newest today, I have Java 1.6.0.13, Eclipse 3.5 and winXP sp3, and when I try to run the emulator from the IDE, on the "Connect to agent" step, the debug/run fails, and I get this Error: "Symbian SDK Error - Failed to initialize session", I've looked on Nokia forums, and wrote Nokia an Email few months ago about this, but they probably don't care, since I got no reply, so perhaps someone here faced this error and found a way around it.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>
Adam.</p>

<p>For example, I've got a business object <code>Person</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Person : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    string Name { get; set; }
    DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }
}
// ^ abbreviated for better legibility; implementation would be trivial
</code></pre>

<p>And I've got some Winforms UI controls data-bound to an object of this class:</p>

<pre><code>Person somePerson = ...;
nameTextBox.DataBindings.Add("Text", somePerson, "Name");
dobDatePicker.DataBindings.Add("Value", somePerson, "DateOfBirth");
</code></pre>

<p>Now I am making changes to <code>somePerson</code> and thanks to having <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> implemented, those changes are reflected in the UI. So far so good.</p>

<p><strong>Now to my problem:</strong> If I make changes to <code>somePerson</code> in a worker thread (ie. not in the UI thread), e.g. because I'm loading data from a DB as a background operation, this might cause exceptions because the data binding attempts to update the controls, which is only allowed to happen on the UI thread.</p>

<p>This means that I need to call <code>InvokeRequired</code> on a UI element to see if I'm allowed to update a business object &mdash; which seems like a <strong>violation of the application's logical layering</strong>.</p>

<p>Ideally, I want to be able to modify my business objects without having to care whether it is data-bound to the UI or not. Is this somehow possible with Winforms data binding, or not?</p>

<p>Then don't use a URL: Use the direct file path and <a href="http://php.net/filesize" rel="nofollow"><code>filesize()</code></a>. </p>

<p>Use <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.filesize.php" rel="nofollow"><code>filesize</code></a> function like this:</p>

<pre><code>echo filesize($filename) . ' bytes';
</code></pre>

<p>You can also format the unit of the size with this function:</p>

<pre><code>function format_size($size) {
      $sizes = array(" Bytes", " KB", " MB", " GB", " TB", " PB", " EB", " ZB", " YB");
      if ($size == 0) { return('n/a'); } else {
      return (round($size/pow(1024, ($i = floor(log($size, 1024)))), 2) . $sizes[$i]); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>this my code with in a array i supposed to make tree menu in a table</p>

<pre><code>$myqueryPO-&gt;magGrp = array("[grp] =&gt; MAIN, [grp] =&gt; P1,  [grp] =&gt; P3")
foreach ( $myqueryPO-&gt;magGrp as $dataArray) {
$myGroup = $dataArray[] = $dataArray['grp'];
    &lt;tr class="'.$myGroup.'"&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="#" id="'.$myGroup.'" class="clickMEdata"&gt;'.$myGroup.'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

}


$(function($) {
$(".clickMEdata").click(function(){
var eleMent = $(this);
var mySelected = eleMent.attr("id");
var info = "myID=" + mySelected;
$.ajax({

data: info,

var loadUrl = "ScheduleOfManPower.php";
 $("."+mySelected).append().load(loadUrl, info);
}
});
$("."+mySelected).toggle("slow");
});
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>supposed to be the ScheduleOfManPower.php is <code>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;hi&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;foo&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;</code> my problem it seem my append function doesnt work my table not fit what i expected its only query in the 1st <code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</code> my second problem is the <code>$("."+mySelected).toggle("slow");</code> it seem i need to double click in order from me to show my query.. :(</p>

<p>What are the bad things present in flowing code:</p>

<pre><code>print "&lt;ul&gt;"
$conn = mysql_connect( "localhost:8080", "root", "admin" );
mysql_select_db( "testdb", $conn ); #selects a database
$q = " SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id &gt; " . $_GET["id"]. ";";
$res = mysql_query( $q, $conn);
while( $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($res) )
{
print "&lt;li&gt;".$row['description']."&lt;/li&gt;";
}
print "&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;";
$q = " SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE id &lt; " . $_GET["id"]. ";";
$res = mysql_query( $q, $conn);
while( $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($res) )
{
print "&lt;li&gt;".$row['description']."&lt;/li&gt;";
}
print "&lt;/ul&gt;";
</code></pre>

<p>as per me the bad things are:</p>

<p>1.) Using hardcoded values for database connection</p>

<p>2.) Bad practise of using <code>$_GET</code> variable without checking it for sql injection.</p>

<p>3.) Should print the database value useing htmlencode</p>

<p>4.) should use <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;br&gt;</code></p>

<p>5.) bad practise of mixing html presentation layer and database interaction layer something like controller</p>

<p>Hi, </p>

<p>I know this subject has been covered before on here but I need a different result to the other questions.</p>

<p>I need to order some results on institution name and then candidates last name.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT candidates.*, histories.job_title, institutions.name
FROM candidates
JOIN histories ON histories.candidate_id = candidates.id
JOIN institutions ON histories.institution_id = institutions.id
WHERE candidates.id IN (1,3,4,6)
ORDER BY institutions.name, candidates.last_name;
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is currently this will return all the candidates joined histories(there current/past employments) but if I add </p>

<pre><code>AND histories.finish_date IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>To the where it won't return candidates who don't have a history or have a finish date set.</p>

<p>Thanks, Alex</p>

<p>Sub Query</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT candidates.*, 
   (SELECT institution_id
        FROM histories
        WHERE histories.candidate_id = candidates.id AND histories.finish_date IS NULL
        LIMIT 1) AS job_title       
   FROM candidates
  JOIN institutions ON histories.institution_id = institutions.id
WHERE candidates.id IN (1,3,4,6)

<p><strong>The short answer</strong></p>

<p>Integral types (<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/typesValues.html#4.2.1" rel="nofollow">JLS 4.2.1</a>) are categorically different from floating point types (<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/typesValues.html#4.2.3" rel="nofollow">JLS 4.2.3</a>). There may be similarities in behavior and operations, but there are also characteristically distinguishing differences such that confusing the two can lead to many pitfalls.</p>

<p>The difference in behavior upon division by zero is just one of these differences. Thus, the short answer is that Java behaves this way because the language says so.</p>

<hr>

<h3>On integral and floating point values</h3>

<p>The values of the integral types are integers in the following ranges:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>byte</code>: from <code>-128</code> to <code>127</code>, inclusive, i.e. <code>[-2</code><sup><code>7</code></sup><code>, 2</code><sup><code>7</code></sup><code>-1]</code></li>
<li><code>short</code>: from <code>-32768</code> to <code>32767</code>, inclusive,  i.e. <code>[-2</code><sup><code>15</code></sup><code>, 2</code><sup><code>15</code></sup><code>-1]</code></li>
<li><code>int</code>: from <code>-2147483648</code> to <code>2147483647</code>, inclusive, i.e. <code>[-2</code><sup><code>31</code></sup><code>, 2</code><sup><code>31</code></sup><code>-1]</code></li>
<li><code>long</code>: from <code>-9223372036854775808</code> to <code>9223372036854775807</code>, inclusive, i.e. <code>[-2</code><sup><code>63</code></sup><code>, 2</code><sup><code>63</code></sup><code>-1]</code></li>
<li><code>char</code>, from <code>'\u0000'</code> to <code>'\uffff'</code> inclusive, that is, from <code>0</code> to <code>65535</code>, i.e. <code>[0, 2</code><sup><code>16</code></sup><code>-1]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The floating-point types are <code>float</code> and <code>double</code>, which are conceptually associated with the single-precision 32-bit and double-precision 64-bit format <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985" rel="nofollow">IEEE 754</a> values and operations.</p>

<p>Their values are ordered as follows, from smallest to greatest:</p>

<ul>
<li>negative infinity,</li>
<li>negative finite nonzero values,</li>
<li>positive and negative zero (i.e. <code>0.0 == -0.0</code>),</li>
<li>positive finite nonzero values, and</li>
<li>positive infinity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, there are special <em>Not-a-Number</em> (<code>NaN</code>) values, which are <em>unordered</em>. This means that if either (or both!) operand is <code>NaN</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>numerical comparison operators <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code> return <code>false</code></li>
<li>numerical equality operator <code>==</code> returns <code>false</code></li>
<li>numerical inequality operator <code>!=</code> returns <code>true</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, <code>x != x</code> is <code>true</code> if and only if <code>x</code> is <code>NaN</code>.</p>

<p>For e.g. <code>double</code>, the infinities and <code>NaN</code> can be referred to as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#POSITIVE_INFINITY" rel="nofollow"><code>Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#NEGATIVE_INFINITY" rel="nofollow"><code>Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#NaN" rel="nofollow"><code>Double.NaN</code></a>, testable with helper method <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html#isNaN%28double%29" rel="nofollow"><code>boolean isNaN(double)</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>The situation is analogous with <code>float</code> and <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Float.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Float</code></a>.</p>

<hr>

<h3>On when exceptions may be thrown</h3>

<p>Numerical operations may only throw an <code>Exception</code> in these cases:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>NullPointerException</code>, if unboxing conversion of a <code>null</code> reference is required</li>
<li><code>ArithmeticException</code>, if the right hand side is zero for <em>integer</em> divide/remainder operations</li>
<li><code>OutOfMemoryError</code>, if boxing conversion is required and there is not sufficient memory</li>
</ol>

<p>They are ordered by importance, with regards to being common source for pitfalls. Generally speaking:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be especially careful with box types, as just like all other reference types, they may be <code>null</code></li>
<li>Be especially careful with the right hand side of an integer division/remainder operations</li>
<li>Arithmetic overflow/underflow <em>DOES NOT</em> cause an exception to be thrown</li>
<li>Loss of precision <em>DOES NOT</em> cause an exception to be thrown</li>
<li>A mathematically indefinite floating point operation <em>DOES NOT</em> cause an exception to be thrown</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>On division by zero</h3>

<p>For <em>integer</em> operation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Division and remainder operations throws <code>ArithmeticException</code> if the right hand side is zero</li>
</ul>

<p>For <em>floating point</em> operation:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the left operand is <code>NaN</code> or <code>0</code>, the result is <code>NaN</code>.</li>
<li>If the operation is <em>division</em>, it overflows and the result is a signed infinity</li>
<li>If the operation is <em>remainder</em>, the result is <code>NaN</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The general rule for all floating point operation is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>An operation that overflows produces a signed infinity.</li>
<li>An operation that underflows produces a denormalized value or a signed zero.</li>
<li>An operation that has no mathematically definite result produces <code>NaN</code>.</li>
<li>All numeric operations with <code>NaN</code> as an operand produce <code>NaN</code> as a result.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's common for compilers to provide a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3375697/useful-gcc-flags-for-c/3376483#3376483">switch to warn when code is unreachable</a>. I've also seen macros for some libraries, that provide <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/2.24/glib-Testing.html#g-assert-not-reached" rel="nofollow">assertions for unreachable code</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a hint, such as through a pragma, or builtin that I can pass to GCC (or any other compilers for that matter), that will warn or error during compilation if it's determined that a line expected to be unreachable can actually be reached?</strong></p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>    if (!conf-&gt;devpath) {
        conf-&gt;devpath = arg;
        return 0;
    } // pass other opts into fuse
    else {
        return 1;
    }
    UNREACHABLE_LINE();
</code></pre>

<p>The value of this is in detecting, after changes in conditions above the expected unreachable line, that the line is in fact reachable.</p>

<p>You will need to determine the format that the two fields are in. Are they seconds from UNIX epoch? Are they YYYYMMDD format? Once you've done that, it would be fairly easy to convert it to a date and compare them.</p>

<p>I'll agree with 1, 2, 3 (though it's <code>htmlentities</code>) and 5. Number 4 is bogus though, using HTML is entirely legitimate.</p>

<p>In addition to those points, <em>horrible</em> formatting; there is no indentation whatsoever.</p>

<p>Also, use <a href="http://php.net/mysqli" rel="nofollow">MySQLi</a> or <a href="http://php.net/pdo" rel="nofollow">PDO</a> instead of the old mysql extension.</p>

<p>Is there a way to trigger the validation on the form on the first load? my form loads its data from the DB and the data could already be partially filled by the user - so i want to run the validation on the first load to show the user what he needs to fill and how much</p>

<p>i failed to mention it earlier - i need to perform the validation on the server side - not client side (all the validators i use have server side validation code as well) - and my attempts to call:</p>

<pre><code>Page.Validate();
Page.Validate("My Validation Group");
</code></pre>

<p>both resulted in</p>

<pre><code>Page.IsValid == true;
</code></pre>

<p>the full scenario is like this:
i have a very long form that stretch over several pages - the user is allowed to move between them and fill in the information - without validation getting in his way
then when he finish he clicks on a different button (that exists on all pages) and that page needs to validate the entire form - and if there is a problem jump the user to where the problem is - i coded all the validation checks into asp.net validation controls - and i whuld like to trigger those controls even if the user jumps to that page by pressing the validate button on a different page - the problem is that the move to that page is regarded as a NEW load of that page (in fact it is - and hence the validation fails to work)</p>

<p>Regular expression for dd/MM/yyyy. it will also support leap year...</p>

<p>I'm working on a non-personal project, so it's safe to say that the maintenance programmer will not be me, for otherwise I wouldn't need to ask this question.</p>

<p>Now there are some constructs (delegates, lambda expressions) which I would like to try in my code, not to intentionally make the code harder to read, but because they lend themselves to the situation (and less code to type as well), and to practice using them as well since I'm new to the language.</p>

<p>However, I'm not sure if the maintenance programmer will know every construct, as many of us didn't come from a c# background, and I'm not sure if he's as enthusiastic about programming as me or just treat it like a regular day job. So my questions are: <ul></p>

<p><ul>
<li><p>Should certain programming constructs be avoided to improve maintainabilily?</p></li>
<li><p>If the answer to the above question is yes, then is the subset of constructs which one should avoid using?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it the responsibility of the maintenance programmer to learn a language fully?
</ul></p></li>
</ul></p>

<p>Hey all.</p>

<p>I am thinking of extracting some core functionality into a new Eclipse GAE project, so I don't have duplicated code. Meaning I now have two Eclipse projects; one "main" and one "util".</p>

<p>I have linked them together locally in Eclipse, but when I deploy the main project, the source code from the second project is not deployed.</p>

<p>Is it possible to specify it should also grab the source code from the secondary project when deploying?</p>

It's not the native output of MongoDB, the Native format is <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/BSON" rel="nofollow">BSON</a>. To Get JSON on the javascript console it must be converted.

<p>I know this question has been closed but I thought I'd let you know that I once created a small project to help me remember how to do Wicket + Spring + Hibernate + JPA.</p>

<p>I didn't write any documentation (except comments), but dig through the web.xml, applicationContext.xml, one of the web pages (dependency injection with spring), WicketApplication and one of the models to see it in action.</p>

<p>The hibernate options specified in the src/main/filters/filters-DEV.properties file expects a postgresql database. You might want to change that to hsqldb or at least change the credentials if you want to take 'er for a spin.</p>

<p>I have a collection of rows, I can generate Table(HTML) out of it using PHP (server side)

<p>Language constructs are added to make the life of a programmer easier. He'll have to learn these eventually anyway so you shouldn't be worrying about it.</p>

<p>Its easier to maintain a linq query rather than nested for loops.</p>

<p>I'm against Least-Common-Denominator coding.  We're professionals, part of what we should be expected to do is learn things that we don't know.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I'm also against glory-coding.  Use the simplest constructs that can get the job done - debugging code is twice as hard as writing it, so you'd better only write code half as clever as you're capable of!</p>

<p>I was trying to use Rhino Mocks with F# code, and the following code was a problematic:</p>

<pre><code>let service = MockRepository.GenerateMock&lt;IMyService&gt;()
service.Stub(s =&gt; s.Name).Return("Service");
</code></pre>

<p>This was no surprise, since Stub is not part of IMyService interface, it's a C# extension method that Rhino Mocks defines.</p>

<p>Slighltly modified code works:</p>

<pre><code>let service = MockRepository.GenerateMock&lt;IMyService&gt;()
RhinoMocksExtensions.Stub&lt;IMyService, string&gt;(service, fun s -&gt; s.Name).Return("Service");
</code></pre>

<p>However, it would be nice to define an extension method in F#, but then it will be a parameterized generic extension method that would take a tuple . I was trying varios syntax but without any luck. I didn't find information whether this is currently supported in F# or not. If anyone knows, please let me know.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am having a problem returning a JsonNetResult for an object when it is a property of another object, however when I fetch the object explicitly it works e.g.  </p>

<pre><code>JsonNetResult res = new JsonNetResult();  
 res.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;  
 res.SerializerSettings.NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore;  
 res.Data = addressRepository.Get(7);  
 return res;
</code></pre>

<p>returns a valid result however    </p>

<pre><code>JsonNetResult res = new JsonNetResult();  
res.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;  
res.SerializerSettings.NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore;  
res.Data = businessRepository.Get(businessID).Address;  
return res;
</code></pre>

<p>will return an empty object; as will   </p>

<pre><code>JsonNetResult res = new JsonNetResult();  
res.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;  
res.SerializerSettings.NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore;
res.Data =  addressRepository.Get(businessRepository.Get(businessID).Address.Id);  
return res;`
</code></pre>

<p>even though the address and it's ID is exactly the same in each situation.
Is there something really obvious I'm missing?</p>

<p>I think the general rule of thumb is to make sure your code is readible with lots of comments, especially in places where you are doing anything that is not straight forward.</p>

<p>Avoiding certain constructs like delegates and lambda expressions shouldn't be the way to go, if used correctly and sensibly, language features like those can greatly reduce the complexity of your code and make them more concise and expressive. After all, that's the beauty of LINQ, is it not? ;-)</p>

<p>I think you should focus on getting your part of the job done as best as you can, whether or not the other programmers have all the necessary knowledge to understand your code is out of your control. If that maintenance programmer leaves, and someone else comes in, what then? You shouldn't tailor your code to suit the maintenance programmer, tailor your code to suit the problem you're tasked to solve instead.</p>

<p>It depends that if you are sorting data frequently on different columns then better is to do it on application level because it will be faster rather then to fetch sorted data each time. </p>

<p>But if it is not the case and you have Index for that then do it on server side as it will be faster then to sort at application side.</p>

<p>The server side would run faster as you do need to go over the collection of rows anyway in order to make a string out of it 
so instead of doing that, you better create the table already...</p>

<p>rendering content using JavaScript in also an anti-pattern of SEO!</p>

<p>In intranet solutions, corporate have complete control over installation and compatibility issues, however Flex is very powerful and we have deployed it for our internet based solutions for more then 3 years and we have been able to achieve greater customer satisfaction then before.</p>

<p>I guess, people are just following some blogs/articles that furiously say "swf requires flash to be installed, so more changes that you may loose customer if he chooses not to install it", however more then 95% of internet users except mobile users have flash installed already.</p>

<p>And also on internet, mobile users are growing so fast, that is still a big reason to stay on html/js as Apple is not supporting flash/silverlight on iPad/iPhone.</p>

<p>However, Android and other mobile platforms are now coming up with Flash/Silverlight solutions, Apple's policy will soon get diluted and then I would see no other reason except SEO to avoid RIA platforms.</p>

<p>I am personally more interested in RIA instead of HTML/JS because, W3C has been sleeping for long time to bring any more new features in HTML and there is no corporate control over W3C's decision of how to improve HTML, where as in case of Flash/Silverlight, competitive vendors keep up with customer's need and they bring new features that will probably be always 10 years ahead of html.</p>

<p>Hi,
I am trying to write an iterator class which returns a getter function return value when it is dereferenced. The code works fine, my only problem is that I would like to write the member_ptr_functor using only one template parameter and not 3, since I am supposed to be able to deduce the types of the argument and return value from the member function type. I think the problematic one is the argument type, I tried using boost::remove_ptr&amp;, but I couldn't compile it.</p>

<p>If you don't mind that plugin's will be release as .py files, you can do something like the following.  Put all your plugin's under a "plugin" subdir, and create an empty "_<em>init</em>_.py".  Doing runtime, it will import the package along with all the modules in that directory.   Check <a href="http://diveintopython.org/functional_programming/all_together.html" rel="nofollow">Dive In Python</a> for explanation... but here's what I finally end up using.</p>

<pre><code>def load_plugin(path):
import imp

moduleNames = sorted(map(filenameToModuleName, files))

<p>Regardless of the validity of other answers, there are known and well-documented artefacts of the floating point implementation that among others, Adobe Flash Player uses.

<p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/office/SourceTools.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/office/SourceTools.aspx</a>

<p>There are at least the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timers.timer.aspx" rel="nofollow">System.Timers.Timer</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.timer.aspx" rel="nofollow">System.Threading.Timer</a> classes that I'm aware of. </p>

<p>One thing to watch out though (if you haven't done this before already), say if you already have the System.Threading namespace in your using clause already but you actually want to use the timer in System.Timers you need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>using System.Threading;
using Timer = System.Timers.Timer;
</code></pre>

<p>Jon Skeet has an article just on Timers in his multithreading guide, it's well worth a read:
<a href="http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/threads/timers.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/threads/timers.shtml</a></p>

<p>I would implement <code>INotifyPropertyChanged</code> regardless (or add a <code>CanExecuteChanged</code> event, which has the same effect). I would try hard for objects to know when to raise the property changed event at the right time, rather than polling.</p>

<p>For instance, in your fictional example, you could have a <code>UserLoggedIn</code> event. In response to that, you could set a 5-minute timer; when that timer elapses, you raise the property changed event.</p>

<p>If you go for the polling approach then you face two dangers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Polling too often, where your application consumes CPU checking for events that can't possibly happen yet (for instance, polling every 10 seconds to see if 5 minutes are up)</li>
<li>Not polling often enough, where controls bound to <code>CanExecute</code> properties lag the rest of the UI (for instance, a delay between making a text selection and the <code>CopyTextCommand.CanExecute</code> property updating)</li>
</ul>

<p>A hybrid approach is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6kc4d8fh.aspx" rel="nofollow">that taken by Microsoft Foundation Classes</a> in C++, which was to make this check any time the application's message loop was idle. This is a reasonable approach when you know that only user interface interaction that can affect your <code>CanExecute</code> property.</p>

<p>I have a MySQL table called "invoice_prod" :</p>

<pre>
id | qte | price | id_tva 
</pre>

<p>And another table called "tva" :</p>

<pre>
id_tva | content
</pre>

<p>Now, I want to find the total of an invoice, so I made this query and it works.</p>

<pre><code>$sql_mnt = mysql_query("
    SELECT SUM( (qte * price) * ( 1 + (tva / 100))) AS total_un_prod
    FROM invoice_prod 
    WHERE id='$id_invoice'
    ");
</code></pre>

<p>I have just one problem with this query. The "tva" return the "id of the tva" and not its content. Which I have to extract its content from the table "tva".</p>

<p>Clearly, this query return this value of the tva : "1", or, it should return "18%" which is the content of the tva's ID.</p>

<p>I tried to make a PHP function that extracts the tva's content from an id and include it into the SQL query like this :</p>

<pre><code>$sql_mnt = mysql_query("
    SELECT SUM(( qte * price) * ( 1 + (" .
    tva_get_by_id(tva) . "/ 100))) AS total_un_prod
    FROM invoice_prod 
    WHRE id='$id_invoice'
    ");

<p>But it doesn't work.</p>

<p>What should I do ?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your help and have a nice day :)</p>

<p>I think that even if you are writing on your own project, it's worth sticking as far as possible to common / standard idioms in whichever language you are using. </p>

<p>I've run into this trap myself - written some code that did something "clever", didn't document it sufficiently, and introduced a serious bug when I came back to change the code a few months later.</p>

<p>My rule of thumb - use the "core language" as much as humanly possible, and when you diverge from this then document your approach thoroughly. Avoid exploiting syntactic sugar to make your code shorter unless it is a really standard idiom (e.g. properties in C#). Readability should trump typing speed every time.</p>

<p>If you are expecting maintenance coders to take over your work, all this is doubly true. You <em>cannot expect</em> maintenance coders to be proficient in multiple paradigms in most organisations. Therefore if you e.g. start using logical / functional programming constructs like lambdas in your object-oriented code then it's a bit like writing a chapter in German in an English book. You might wish your readers were multi-lingual enthusiasts, but it's most likely that they are not.</p>

<p>Hi</p>

<p>I am declaring an array using new</p>

<pre><code>int *a = NULL;
a = new int[10];

a[0] = 23;
a[1] = 43;
a[2] = 45;
a[3] = 76;
a[4] = 34;
a[5] = 85;
a[6] = 34;
a[7] = 97;
a[8] = 45;
a[9] = 22;

PrintElements(a, 10);

void PrintElements(int * array, int size){
    for (int i=0; i&lt;size; i++) {
        cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; array[i];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now when I print the values I am getting these values</p>

<pre>
17
2b
2d
4c
22
55
22
61
2d
16
</pre>

<p>Can somebody tell me what am I doing wrong...?
On the other hand when I dont use new &amp; initialize array without it everything works fine.</p>

<p>If your compiler does not have the warning that you need, it can be complemented with a static analyzer. The kind of analyzer I am talking about would have its own annotation language and/or recognize C <code>assert</code>, and use these for hints of properties that should be true at specific points of the execution. If there isn't a specific annotation for unreachable statements, you could probably use <code>assert (false);</code>.</p>

<p>I am not personally familiar with them but Klokwork and CodeSonar are two famous analyzers. Goanna is a third one.</p>

<p>I improved the function call as Artefacto suggested – but the function still didn't return a reference for elements retrieved by recursion only.</p>

<p>The mistake was, in this case, the recursion call itself. Below you will find an adjusted version which works for me:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($pref_array as $key =&gt; $data) {
        if (is_array($data)) {
            $res = &amp;$this-&gt;find($idx, &amp;$pref_array[$key]);
            if ($res !== false)
                return $res;
        }
        else if ($key == $idx) {
            return $pref_array[$idx];
        }
    }

<p>Calling <code>&amp;$this-&gt;find($idx, $data);</code> before was wrong as <code>$data</code> actually was no reference. In order to get a reference to the array I just had to fetch the array from the <em>referenced</em> variable (<code>$pref_array</code>).</p>

<p>Thanks a lot guys.</p>

<p>What are the naming conventions you use for application domain model classes and presentation layer classes? Postfixes/Prefixes to distinguish the aim of the class from the first sight:</p>

<p>For example information about the person that is returned from DAL can be </p>

<pre><code>public class PersonEntity 
{
  public Guid Id { get; set; }
  public SexType Sex { get; set; }
  public Date Birthdate { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public string Family { get; set; }
  public string Patronymic { get; set; }
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>or may be you prefer <code>PersonData</code> or <code>PersonInfo</code> or something more appropriate? </p>

<p>Than I use databinding to create appropriate presentation. For example <code>SexType</code> should be converted to localized string (Male, Mann, Homme, Hombre, ...) <code>Birthdate</code> to appropriate date format (YYYY.MM.DD, DD.MM.YYYY, ...) and full name into -> Family N.P.</p>

<p>So I use another layer of classes for presentation databindings. Something like </p>

<pre><code>public class PersonDecorator
{
  public string Sex { get; set; }
  public string Date { get; set; }
  public string FullName { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>or may it's better to name such class <code>PersonPresenter</code>, or <code>PersonView</code>, or something more appropriate? </p>

<p>Thank you in advance! </p>

<p>I think it's possible to somehow hook with the windows environment (specifically explorer.exe) and trigger specific things, for example launching control panel and using it as if I had mouse (meaning I'm clicking the interface from the code).</p>

<p>Basically what I'm trying to do is automate some redundant tasks I do often, just I don't know how it's done, or even how it's called. Anyone can point me in right direction?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>As far as I know, Save Dialog will only be invoked in the Button click event, so when you receive http response, you will not get permission to open save dialogbox at all. </p>

<p>What you should do is, in your any button click event, probably download button, in the click event, you should call File Dialog and open the file stream that you will be using later on when you receive web server's response.</p>

<p>I believe especially  lambda-expressions make the code easier to read if anything. Instead of having multiple for-each's with lots of conditionals - a clean lambda can almost be read.</p>

<p>From my experience things that make code hard to read is clever generic Func arguments... These often only take out tw0+ easy to read functions and replace it with a generic hard-to-read one.</p>

<p>So, it is more important in my book to have methods with good names than avoiding certain constructs. But don't worry about them not knowing them - they should learn them anyhow.</p>

<p>The mongrel gem can do this easy.</p>

<pre><code>gem install mongrel
</code></pre>

<p>Then you should be able to use</p>

<pre><code>mongrel_rails start -d
</code></pre>

<p><code>-d</code> for daemon mode.</p>

<p>(I'm pretty sure <code>xs:anyURL</code> is not valid. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#anyURI" rel="nofollow">XML Schema standard</a> calls it <code>anyURI</code>. And since <code>link-url</code> is an attribute, shouldn't you be using <code>xs:attribute</code> instead of <code>xs:element</code>?)</p>

<p>You could restrict the URIs by creating a new <code>simpleType</code> <code>base</code>d on it, and put a <code>restriction</code> on the <code>pattern</code>. For example,</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python2.6

from lxml import etree
from StringIO import StringIO

schema_doc = etree.parse(StringIO('''
    &lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"&gt;

    &lt;xs:simpleType name="httpURL"&gt;
        &lt;xs:restriction base="xs:anyURI"&gt;
            &lt;xs:pattern value='https?://.+'/&gt;
            &lt;!-- accepts only http:// or https:// URIs. --&gt;
        &lt;/xs:restriction&gt;
    &lt;/xs:simpleType&gt;

    &lt;xs:element name="a"&gt;
        &lt;xs:complexType&gt;
            &lt;xs:attribute name="link-url" type="httpURL"/&gt;
        &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
    &lt;/xs:element&gt;
    &lt;/xs:schema&gt;
''')) #/
schema = etree.XMLSchema(schema_doc)

schema.assertValid(etree.parse(StringIO('&lt;a link-url="http://sd" /&gt;')))
assert not schema(etree.parse(StringIO('&lt;a link-url="server/path" /&gt;')))

<p>It doesnt have anything to do with the static or dynamic allocation of the array.</p>

<p>The numbers are printed as Hexadecimal values and not decimal values.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form method="post" action="confirm_login_credentials.php"&gt;
    &lt;table&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;User ID:&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="text" id="uid"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Password:&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="text" id="pass"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;

<p>I am using image inspite of submit button. How can send login details when user clicks on login image like submit button does?</p>

<p>In general, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>command &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>And it will detach from the terminal window.</p>

<p>If you are using Linux, another options is to use <code>screen</code>:</p>

<pre><code>screen
# start your process
# press Ctrl+a
# press Ctrl+d
</code></pre>

<p>Voila! It's detached. Then you can call <code>screen -r</code> and your process will be back as if nothing happened.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I would love to build an osx application this summer but I don't want to make it all by myself as I want it to be really cool. Is there a way to find opensource projects (maybe a forum?) to find motivated programmers?</p>

<p>I have a lot of ideas for osx apps and maybe  also iphone apps. I have experience, if you're interested in joining me, don't hesitate to get in touch.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>You may have written a std::hex to the cout at some point; that will remain in effect until overridden.</p>

<p>use</p>

<pre><code>$sql_mnt = mysql_query("
         SELECT SUM((`qte`*`price`)*(1+(`content`/100))) AS `total_un_prod`
         FROM `invoice_prod`
         LEFT JOIN `tva` USING (`id_tva`)
         WHERE `id`='".mysql_real_escape_string($id_invoice)."'");
</code></pre>

<p>this connects the two tables within mysql, so you can use the <code>content</code> field directly, which I presume holds the TVA percentage.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> formatted and addressed the escaping of <code>id_invoice</code> as well (I guess it is int so a cast would suffice, but if not, this will work as well)</p>

<p>What is the best way to convert a string to hex and vice versa in C++?</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>A string like "Hello World" to hex format: 48656C6C6F20576F726C64
And from hex 48656C6C6F20576F726C64 to string: "Hello World"</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I wrote a simple WebServer using HttpListener class (.net 2.0)</p>

<p>It seems that It doesn't work on port other then 80.</p>

<p>When i sniff the transport to my server i can see the Syn packets on Port 8080 arrive to the server, but there is no Syn/Ack response, although when i sue netstat -a i can see that the server is listening to port 8080 (i verified that my application is the one that listens)</p>

<pre><code>HttpListener server = new HttpListener()
server.Prefixes.Add("http://192.168.4.133:8080/");
server.Start();
_log.Write("Waiting for a connection... ");
HttpListenerContext context = server.GetContext();
HttpListenerRequest request = context.Request;
HttpListenerResponse response = context.Response;
_log.Write("Got request for " + request.RawUrl);
</code></pre>

<p>the above code doesn't receive any Context (stuck at the line server.GetContext())
if i change the Prefix to "http://192.168.4.133/"
the above code works perfectly.</p>

<p>when i am testing it on Port 80, i am killing the IIS services, and making sure that my application is the one that listen to the relevant port.</p>

<p>i am running this on XP, so i don't think it is security issues....but you never know..
i have read about the httpcfg tool, but didnt really understood it...</p>

<p>is there something inherntly diffrent between listening on port 80 to listening on other ports? 8080 or even better another random  user port?
Thanks,
Itay</p>

<p>the best way is to use configure to set <em>all</em> the scripts to require login.</p>

<p>you need to hit 'yes i've read all the docco' button at the top, and then expand the Security section</p>

<p>in there is a setting called {AuthScripts}. any cgi script listed there will require authentication first - so list <em>all</em> of them.</p>

<p>alternatively, you can restrict access to a web or topic using the ACL settings - see <a href="http://foswiki.org/System/AccessControl" rel="nofollow">http://foswiki.org/System/AccessControl</a></p>

<p>If I do this:</p>

<pre><code>class LoadWords {
  public static void main(String... args) {
    try {
      Scanner s = new Scanner(new File("/usr/share/dict/words"));
      ArrayList&lt;String&gt; ss = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();
      while (s.hasNextLine())
        ss.add(s.nextLine());
      System.out.format("Read %d words\n", ss.size());
    } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
      e.printStackTrace(System.err);
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can run it with <code>java -mx16m LoadWords</code>, which limits the Java heap size to 16 Mb, which is not that much memory for Java.  My <code>/usr/share/dict/words</code> file has approximately 250,000 words in it, so it may be a bit smaller than yours.</p>

<p>You'll need to use a different data structure than the simple <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code> that I've used. Perhaps a <code>HashMap</code> of <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code>,  keyed on the starting letter of the word would be a good starting choice.</p>

<p>Use whatever your team is most familiar with, all other things being equal.</p>

<p>In practice it is FAR more useful to have a development team who can work with a tool, rather than a tool being "Better".</p>

<p>If you do not have people on your team with several years with one or the other, it is not a good team to be developing such an application; if you have to ask on Stackoverflow, maybe you have bigger problems.</p>

<p>You could use an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.4.1" rel="nofollow">image submit button</a>:</p>

<p>Hello</p>

<p>is there any way to make code for studio debugger atomic? e.g.</p>

<pre><code>#magic(atomarize) :D
for(int i=0;i&lt;100;++i)
{
  //actions
}

// other statements
</code></pre>

<p>so when debugger comes to the for statement, it doesn't show how it's executed (it executes internally) and at once goes to the other statement</p>

<p>Windows Explorer has a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776890.aspx" rel="nofollow">COM object model</a> that you can call from both C# and C++. (Most of the examples on MSDN are in Javascript or VBScript, which I guess aren't your languages of choice, but they demonstrate that the API is straightforward to call.)</p>

<p>I am not sure I understand correctly what you're doing here, but it looks like what you want is an INNER JOIN on the tva table, and then use tva.content in your calculation. Is that correct?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" rel="nofollow">AutoHotKey</a> is a scripting environment specifically designed for this sort of task</p>

<p>Check if you're firewall is on or off and if on, whether prohibiting this port access.
You can termorarily turn it of for the test just to make sure.</p>

<p>Side note: No need to be hunting down and killing IIS processes, simply stop the IIS windows service (run the command "services.msc" to see a list)</p>

<p>I'd suggest checking your firewall, and if you don't find anything -- try to run another server on 8080 and check if it's working (so you know that it's the port, not the server).</p>

<p>I have a WinForms control inherited from TreeView and I want it to automatically adjust background color according to the form (also customized) background. How to make it?</p>

<p>In my experience, there are a great many more ideas than motivated programmers.  By far the best way to draw people to work on a project is to start by creating something that works and is already interesting and/or useful.  Once people can see your concept in action, they will be far more likely to get involved.</p>

<p>You could put the code in a separate method and apply a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerstepthroughattribute.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>[DebuggerStepThrough]</code></a> attribute to it.</p>

<p>As the Col. said you free to choose either. However, which one of them is appropriate is depending on the task.</p>

<p>I think, there are quite a few things to consider when you design a web application/web site. Deciding which elements are going to be built server side - therefore relying on the resources of the server, and which should be processed on the client computer is always a crucial part of the plan.</p>

<p>Too many server side processes can put a significant load on the server in case of a popular web site for instance. (in some cases these processes could become defunct processes and they are a real pain)</p>

<p>Keeping fuctionality partially on client side tends to ease the load. 
If there are no usability (speed, browser dependance, SEO etc) implications it is best practice.</p>

<p>Ok, this sounds interesting.
I made a c++ version of a soulution, I don't know if this helps you. I think it works fast enough as it's almost instant on a 800*600 matrix. If you have any questions just ask.</p>

<p>Sorry for any mistakes I've made, it's a 10min code...
This is a iterative version (I was planing on making a recursive one too, but I've changed my mind).
The algorithm could be improved by not adding any point to the points array that is to a larger distance from the starting point then the min_dist, but this involves calculating for each pixel (despite it's color) the distance from the starting point.</p>

<p>Hope that helps</p>

<p><em><strong>If you were using some other control apart from the <code>TreeView</code>, the following advice would apply:</em></strong></p>

<p>I haven't tried this on the <code>TreeView</code> control specifically, but the WinForms convention is that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.color.transparent.aspx" rel="nofollow">setting <code>control.BackColor = Color.Transparent</code> causes the parent background to show through</a>.</p>

<p>Don't forget in gui debuggers like Visual Studio you have a "run to cursor" option - so you can set your cursor after the loop and then run straight past it.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I've been asking, searching, rating and reading for about a week now trying to get a decent source control process up together and my major stumbling block has been references to projects in other repositories and managing third party libraries.  This was compounded by conflicting views on whether to store binaries in the source control system</p>

<p>So, here are the main rules that I intend to apply (in no particular order):</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep all third-party libraries in a separate source control repository</li>
<li>Store only the source of the library and checkout and build when you need it.  If the source isn't available, just store the binaries</li>
<li>When you need to use one of these external libraries, make it a part of your build script to checkout and build from source control (add some 'check for file' statements to your build scripts so that the library is only built on first checkout to save build time)</li>
<li>When referencing a project outside of the current solution (i.e. one of your organisations 'Common' libraries, use the same method as using an external library but ALWAYS checkout a release branch!</li>
<li>An exception to the above... If you need to add functionality to the common library, create a new branch and include a project reference into your solution.  But don't forget to revert to the above method when the changes have been made and accepted back into the trunk</li>
</ul>

<p>All comments and feedback welcome. Please be harsh! I need to get this right first time!</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, I see two ways:</p>

<li><p>Store the instance in the model plug-in itself, using ‘SimulationFactory.getInstance(String myAppId)‘. The passed String is a constant in you app that is always used, when obtaining the reference.</p></li>
<li><p>Define a new class e.g. GlobalAccess in you app that is initilized with an instance of your model and has some getter (whether you use a single instance again or only provide public static methods is a matter of taste).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The seocond way is similar to some classes in eclipse like platfom or platformui, where you can obtain initial references and navigate through the workbench.</p>

<p><em>edit</em></p>

<p>i just found a tutorial that might help you:
<a href="http://www.techjava.de/topics/2009/07/passing-data-between-plug-ins/" rel="nofollow">Passing Data between Plug-ins</a></p>

<p>Regarding the edited question,</p>

<p>This is because the digits are still not uniformly distributed even if you <code>% 10000</code>. Assume <code>RAND_MAX == 32767</code>, and <code>rand()</code> is perfectly uniform.</p>

<p>For every 10,000 numbers counting from 0, all of the digits will appear uniformly (4,000 each). However, 32,767 is not divisible by 10,000. Therefore, these 2,768 numbers will provide more leading 0, 1 and 2's to the final count.</p>

<p>The exact contribution from these 2,768 numbers are:</p>

<pre><code>digits count
0      1857
1      1857
2      1625
3      857
4      857
5      857
6      855
7      815
8      746
9      746
</code></pre>

<p>adding 12,000 for the initial 30,000 numbers to the count, then divide by the total number of digits (4&times;32,768) should give you the expected distribution:</p>

<pre><code>number  probability (%)
0       10.5721
1       10.5721
2       10.3951
3        9.80911
4        9.80911
5        9.80911
6        9.80759
7        9.77707
8        9.72443
9        9.72443
</code></pre>

<p>which is close to what you get.</p>

<p>If you want to truly uniform digit distribution, you need to <em>reject</em> those 2,768 numbers:</p>

<pre><code>int rand_4digits() {
  const int RAND_MAX_4_DIGITS = RAND_MAX - RAND_MAX % 10000;
  int res;
  do {
    res = rand();
  } while (res &gt;= RAND_MAX_4_DIGITS);
  return res % 10000;
}

<p>These are obviously hexadecimal numbers. If you print them as decimals you get 23, 43, etc. IOW, exactly the numbers that you have put into the array. Some piece of your code executed prior to your <code>PrintElements()</code> apparently changes the formatting to output hexadecimal numbers.</p>

<p>This works perfect in Linux, so I suppose also on OSX and Windows. I also tested it after resizing the columns: it still know which columns was pressed. But after reordering the columns, the column which was first "column 0" became "column 1".<br>
But you can always disallow the user to move the columns with this:</p>

<pre><code>table.getTableHeader().setReorderingAllowed(false);
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, if I look at the response headers for the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;vps=1&amp;jsv=259e&amp;msa=0&amp;output=georss&amp;msid=116513045936489823517.00048c3278b3eefd11b13" rel="nofollow">RSS representation of one of my Google Maps</a>, there is no Last-Modified header. I want to do a conditional GET of the RSS (in C#).</p>

<p>I'm surprised because I thought RSS files would be especially likely to contain information in the response headers about their last updated time, given that they tend to represent resources that are expected to change over time.</p>

<p>So, how can I tell, without a full download of the RSS file, whether it has changed since the last time I got it? Or is that not possible?</p>

<p>Here are the requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>must not rely on any type of known server, i.e. server code (that produces the map images) is not of a known variety</li>
<li>supports panning and zooming (image is zoomed on the client)</li>
<li>preferably with support for tiling (i.e. pre-fetching image tiles with some simple heuristics)</li>
<li>JQuery friendly</li>
</ol>

<p>The API doesn't have to be specifically for maps. i.e., similar kind of manipulation on an image is also OK.</p>

<p>I have an Xulrunner app that loads fullscreen without any controls and loads a html page by default. The only thing it has is browser element and a popup menu visible on right click. 
In the popup menu there is option to quit. Then there is a menu entry 'theme2'. I want the browser to load another html when theme2 is clicked.</p>

<p>This is my main.xul, thats loaded by default:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;

function do()
{
 var browser1 = document.getElementById('browser');
 browser1.loadURI("chrome://myapp/content/theme2/home.html");
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;browser id="browser" type="content" src="chrome://myapp/content/theme1/index.html" flex="1" context="clipmenu"/&gt;



&lt;popupset&gt;
  &lt;menupopup id="clipmenu"&gt;

    &lt;menuseparator/&gt;
    &lt;menuitem label="Exit" oncommand="close();"/&gt;
  &lt;/menupopup&gt;
&lt;/popupset&gt;

&lt;/window&gt;

<p>I tried this, but when the page is loaded this way.. the popup menu is nomore in the new page.</p>

<pre><code>window.location.assign()
</code></pre>

<p>There is something like <code>loaduri()</code>, but i have no idea on how to use it.</p>

<p>The code below works fine at 1280x800, however, if I add another thumbnail, the width of the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> becomes equal to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> width and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> isn't centered anymore. I don't want to specify the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> width, which would solve the problem. I want thumbnails to occupy all free space regardless of resolution, but at the same time having equal margins on the left and right. Is there any pure CSS way of doing this without calculating the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>'s width in JavaScript each time the page loads or using CSS3 media queries?</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm not sure what the question is. Python <code>*args</code> collects any number of args,
which a function can unpack as it pleases; see

<p>Linear algebra, maybe a little calculus, and a lot of testing.</p>

<p>There's no real mystery to this sort of thing, but people often just don't think about it in the rigorous terms you need to get a system that is fairly well-balanced.</p>

<p>Basically the designers know how quickly you can gather resources (both the best case and the average case), and they know how long it takes to build a unit, and they know roughly how powerful a unit is (eg. by reference to approximations such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damage_per_second" rel="nofollow">damage per second</a>). With this, you can ensure a unit's cost in resources makes sense. And from that, it's possible to compare resource gathering with unit cost to model the strength of a force growing over time. Similarly you can measure a force's capacity for damage over time, and compare the two. If there's a big disparity then they can tweak one or more of the variables to reduce it. Obviously there are many permutations of units but the interesting thing is that you only really need to understand the most powerful permutations - if a player picks a poor combination then it's ok if they lose. You don't want every approach to be equally good, as that would imply a boring game where your decisions are meaningless.</p>

<p>This is, of course, a simplification, but it helps get everything in roughly the right place and ensure that there are no units that are useless. Then testing can hammer down the rough edges and find most of the exploits that remain.</p>

<p>There's no doubt a better way, but one method might be to create a class (e.g. 'Trophy') that is thread safe, has a method 'getTrohpy' that only returns true on the first call, and pass a reference to an instance of Trophy to both threads.</p>

<p>Hi itsandy
I faced exactly the same problem as you describe. Read a lot of forums. Tried almost everything with permission, pear, via ssh and connect to no avail.
It shows downloading ..done (and the archieve) is in the downloader/pearlib/download folder) but doesn't show any installation signs that usually ends with installation...ok.
It just stuck.
Have you managed to fight it? I'd appreciate if you could share the results.</p>

<p>No it is too late, the instance is already created when the apply() method returns. </p>

<p>What you can do is using the traits inside the factory method. The code below is from a rather big code example I am writing:</p>

<pre><code>object Avatar {
 // Avatar factory method
 def apply(name: String, race: RaceType.Value, character: CharacterType.Value
  ): Avatar = {
    race match {
      case RaceType.Dwarf =&gt; {
        character match {
          case CharacterType.Thief =&gt; new Avatar(name) with Dwarf with Thief
          case CharacterType.Warrior =&gt; new Avatar(name) with Dwarf with Warrior
          case CharacterType.Wizard =&gt; new Avatar(name) with Dwarf with Wizard
        }
      }
      case RaceType.Elf =&gt; {
        character match {
          case CharacterType.Thief =&gt; new Avatar(name) with Elf with Thief
          case CharacterType.Warrior =&gt; new Avatar(name) with Elf with Warrior
          case CharacterType.Wizard =&gt; new Avatar(name) with Elf with Wizard
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

class Avatar(val name: String) extends Character {
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this code the type (profession and race) of your Avatar is decided in the factory based on the RaceType and CharacterType enumerations. What you have is <em>one</em> factory for all sorts of different types or type combinations.  </p>

<p>In order to get your XML contents as rows from a "pseudo-table", you need to use the <code>.nodes()</code> on the XML column - something like:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @xmlfield XML
SET @xmlfield = '&lt;root&gt;&lt;id&gt;2&lt;/id&gt;&lt;id&gt;6&lt;/id&gt;&lt;id&gt;14&lt;/id&gt;&lt;/root&gt;'

SELECT
   ROOT.ID.value('(.)[1]', 'int')
FROM
   @xmfield.nodes('/root/id') AS ROOT(ID)

SELECT
    (list of fields)
FROM
    dbo.Contacts c
INNER JOIN
    @xmlfield.nodes('/root/id') AS ROOT(ID) ON c.ID = Root.ID.value('(.)[1]', 'INT')  
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the <code>.nodes()</code> defines a pseudo-table <code>ROOT</code> with a single column <code>ID</code>, that will contain one row for each node in the XPath expression, and the <code>.value()</code> selects a specific value out of that XML fragment.</p>

<ol>
<li>You are printing out every line read, not just the unique lines.</li>
<li>Your deleteDuplicateLines() method won't do anything, as there will never be any duplicates in the HashMap.</li>
</ol>

<p>So it isn't at all clear what your actual problem is.</p>

<p>Hope this doesn't spoil your fun or something, but if I were you I'd take this approach..</p>

<p>Pseudo java:</p>

<pre><code>abstract class Word {
    String word;
    char last();
    char first();         
}

abstract class DynamicDictionary {
    Map&lt;Character,Set&lt;Word&gt;&gt; first_indexed;

    Word removeNext(Word word){
        Set&lt;Word&gt; candidates = first_indexed.get(word.last());
        return removeRandom(candidates);
    }

    /**
     * Remove a random word out from the entire dic.
     */
     Word removeRandom();

    /**
     * Remove and return a random word out from the set provided.
     */
     Word removeRandom(Set&lt;Word&gt; wordset);    
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>Word primer = dynamicDictionary.removeRandom();
List&lt;Word&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Word&gt;(500);
list.add(primer);
for(int i=0, Word cur = primer;i&lt;499;i++){
    cur = dynamicDictionary.removeNext(cur);
    list.add(cur);
}
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: Not intended to be viewed as actual java code, just a way to roughly explain the approach (no error handling, not a good class structure if it were really used, no encupsulation etc. etc.)  </p>

<p>Should I encounter memory issues, maybe I'll do this:</p>

<pre><code>abstract class Word {
    int lineNumber;
    char last();
    char first();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If that is not sufficient, guess I'll use a binary search on the file or put it in a DB etc.. </p>

<p>The view you see in the Document Library is rendered by XSL, so there is no direct option that will allow you get the list of selected items from server side code. But there is an alternate that I can suggest.</p>

<p>Article in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sharepoint/archive/2010/02/15/enabling-a-button-on-the-ribbon-based-on-selection.aspx" rel="nofollow">this link</a> suggest how to get selected items in javascript code, you can use similar code and fill in a hidden box with those values &amp; use them at server side. You might need to add a custom ribbon command to achive this.</p>

<p>my html code is</p>

<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;User ID:&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="text" id="uid" size="20"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;Password:&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type="password" id="pass" size="20"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>but the problem is, password textbox length is coming diffrent in IE, means <code>uid</code> size is <code>20</code> but <code>pass</code> size is around <code>17</code>.</strong></p>

<p>This comparison looks promising</p>

<p>Try:</p>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; dec &lt;&lt; //all your stuff here

<p>It's still set in hex mode.</p>

<p>First off: your <code>RaceHorse</code> objects are themselves threads.  You should be able to say <code>obj.start();</code> and it'd work just as well.  So remove <code>t</code> and <code>t2</code> entirely.</p>

<p>Next, you'll need some way to notify the main thread about the winner.</p>

<pre><code>public void run()
{
    ... your loop stuff ...
    // this is how we're going to do the notification.
    Runner.done();
}

public class Runner
{
    private static RaceHorse winner = null;
    synchronized static void done()
    {
        // Threads calling this are going to be RaceHorse objects.
        // Now, if there isn't already a winner, this RaceHorse is the winner.
        if (winner == null) winner = (RaceHorse) Thread.currentThread();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
         ... create the horses ...
         // start the horses running
         obj.start();
         obj2.start();

         // wait for them to finish
         obj.join();
         obj2.join();

         System.out.println(winner.name + " wins!");
    }
}

<p>the check must give me a 200 or status ok</p>

<p>--------------edited-------------------</p>

<pre><code>var imgsrc = $(this).attr('src');
var imgcheck = imgsrc.width;


if (imgcheck==0) {
alert("You have a zero size image");
} else { //do rest of code }

<p>Thanks

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dhh" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.com/dhh</a></p>

<p>Try using <code>style="width:200px"</code> for example rather than specifying size that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" id="uid" style="width:200px;"&gt;
&lt;input type="password" id="pass" style="width:200px;"&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Or you can create a class in the CSS like this:</p>

<pre><code>.input{
  width:200px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And use like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" id="uid" class="input"&gt;
&lt;input type="password" id="pass" class="input"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It was easier than I thought.</p>

<p>You just have to right-click on the project then take "Properties", "Java Build Path" and then link a new "Source" folder.</p>

<p>You can fix it with <code>width: 150px;</code> (with CSS).</p>

<p>In CSS file :</p>

<pre><code>input {
  width: 150px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or in inline CSS : <code>style="width: 150px;"</code> .</p>

<p><strong>Edit :</strong> Grilled :) .</p>

<p>For putting together a site from scratch, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using external database services, e.g. MongoHQ, Amazon RDS?</p>

<p>I have the following recursive function:</p>

<pre><code>ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[ListAncestors] 
(   
    @Id int
)   
RETURNS TABLE  
As  
RETURN  
(   
    WITH cte As  
    (   
        SELECT
            UserId,
            ManagerId,  
            Forename,
            Surname  
        FROM  
            dbo.Users   
        WHERE  
            UserId = @Id   

        UNION ALL  

        SELECT  
            T.UserID,
            T.ManagerID,  
            T.Forename,   
            T.Surname  
        FROM  
            cte As C INNER JOIN dbo.Users As T   
            ON C.UserID = T.ManagerID   
    )   
    SELECT
        Forename,
   Surname 
    FROM  
        cte
);
</code></pre>

<p>Basically what it does is returns the names of all users below the specified user (based on their ID). What I would like to do is modify this function and create another function which does a check if a specific userID is an ancestor of another.</p>

<p>I imagine the signature would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION IsAncestor(@Id int, @AncestorId int) RETURNS BIT

<p>Hi, This is just to work out a problem which looks pretty interesting. I tried to think over it, but couldn't find the way to solve this, in efficient time. May be my concepts are still building up... anyways the question is as follows..</p>

<p>Wanted to find out all possible permutation of a given string....... Also, share if there could be any possible variations to this problem.</p>

<p>I found out a solution on net, that uses recursion.. but that doesn't satisfies as it looks bit erroneous.</p>

<p>the program is as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>void permute(char s[], int d)
{
   int i;

   if(d == strlen(s))
      printf("%s",s);

   else
   {
      for(i=d;i&lt;strlen(s);i++)
      {
         swap(s[d],s[i]);
         permute(s,d+1);
         swap(s[d],s[i]);
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If this program looks good (it is giving error when i ran it), then please provide a small example to understand this, as i am still developing recursion concepts..</p>

<p>Any other efficient algorithm, if exists, can also be discussed.... </p>

<p>And Please,, this is not a HW........</p>

<p>Thanks.............</p>

<p>If you are using object input and output streams, you have to use the same ones for the life of the connection, or new ones for every object, at the same time, which is pretty hard to arrange. Same ones forever is simplest. This exception can arise when one end uses the same stream forever and the other end keeps creating new ones.</p>

<p>Hello All,</p>

<p>I am using the jquery to validate each field in my form and also using the jquery to show a "loading" message after submitting the form. Now, in my case I got confused when I clicked on the submit button the validation messages will be shown and also the loading message. I need only the loading message to be shown once everything is correct.</p>

<p>I took this code when one of the colleagues had helped and now I want to complete this.</p>

<p>Is there a way to authenticate a user with facebook in the background using id/pass he entered in configuration screen? I mean authentication without the usage of UIWebView, but using some kind of Http client to retrieve auth token (OAuth 2.0 preferably)</p>

<p>I am not going to write the code for you; but you should take a look at the <code>notify</code> method (see <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#notify%28%29" rel="nofollow">here</a>) to be used. </p>

<p>One approach could be: once a thread has finished it will <code>wait()</code> for the other thread(s) to notify (or <code>notifyAll()</code>).</p>

<p>Another, more elegant solution, would consist of using a <code>synchronized</code> block on a shared object; the <code>syncrhonized(obj)</code> statement would be at the end of the run() method. Into that statement you could put a printline or any other code you would deem useful to determine who won the race.</p>

<p>I don't know if I was missing something but here is how I fixed it.
In my OF delegate implementation if added this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)dashboardDidDisappear
{
   MyAppDelegate *appDelegate = (MyAppDelegate *)[[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];

   [[[appDelegate viewController] view] setFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, SCREEN_HEIGHT, SCREEN_WIDTH)];
}
</code></pre>

<p>having defined SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT accordingly...</p>

<p>I hope this will help...</p>

<p>I guess COM's Microsoft Interface Description Language does not allow it. So it's just an adaptation for the Windows environment, much like prefixing interface names with <code>I</code>.</p>

<p>Nutch is unbeatable. Another more simple lib which I used successfully in projects is <a href="https://crawler.dev.java.net/" rel="nofollow">https://crawler.dev.java.net/</a>. You find examples on <a href="https://crawler.dev.java.net/samples.html" rel="nofollow">https://crawler.dev.java.net/samples.html</a>.</p>

<p>At first, after pondering your problem I thought it was somewhat impossible. But then I realized you could take advantage of the way images are displayed and work within the browser. Try the following code and see if it works for your purposes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Gallery&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style type="text/css" media="screen"&gt;
        body {

        }
        div {
            text-align:center;
        }
        .thumb {
            display:inline;
            margin:5px;
        }
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;div class="thumb"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid/cat2.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="thumb"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid/cat2.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="thumb"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid/cat2.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="thumb"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid/cat2.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="thumb"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid/cat2.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="thumb"&gt;&lt;img src="http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid/cat2.jpg" width="200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<p>You could, if you wanted to, even remove the container around the images. But it leaves it open for some sort of caption.</p>

<p>I know of at least one commercial enterprise that decided they would never move beyond 1.1 so that they could run forever on both java JVMS and .NET with the same source code.</p>

<p>This doesn't answer your question, but I try as far as possible to avoid this problem.</p>

<p>Because of the existence of data binding, I make sure the only code that can update business objects is code that's running on the GUI thread.</p>

<p>For async operations, I adopt a pattern of:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Send work to the background:</strong> Trigger an async operation -- say, a thread pool item -- from the GUI thread. Pass only plain data types into the thread pool, and receive only plain data types back. If business objects are used by the thread pool, make sure that these are either brand new ones (that haven't been data bound yet), or are clones of the originals (to avoid concurrent access)</li>
<li><strong>Do the work and obtain a result:</strong> Execute the async operation on a background thread. The background thread code will own the 'safe' objects given to it by the GUI; it won't have any interaction with the rest of the application.</li>
<li><strong>Unpack the result in the GUI:</strong> When the async operation is finished, it triggers an 'I am complete' event on the GUI thread. In response, the GUI thread can unpackage any results from the background operation and merge them back into the main business objects, safe in the knowledge that it won't be dealing with concurrent access.</li>
</ol>

<p>I can recommend the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.task.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>System.Threading.Tasks.Task</code></a> class as an abstraction around most of the above steps. It's new in .NET 4.0, but it's also available as a separate download for .NET 3.5 apps.</p>

<p>Steps (1) and (2) are what the <code>Task</code> class does without any customisation. You can achieve (3) by spawning a separate <code>Task</code> from inside the background thread and specifying <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.taskscheduler.fromcurrentsynchronizationcontext.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext</code></a> as a scheduler. (You'll need to call <code>FromCurrentSynchronizationContext</code> from the GUI thread, in step (1), not from the background thread.)</p>

<p>Advantage: you don't have to fix it yourself when it breaks.<br>
Disadvantage: you can't fix it yourself when it breaks.</p>

<p><strong>It's best to avoid Javascript in this case</strong>, unless you really want every bit of processing on the client end; you will not benefit much by printing the data with JavaScript, and there we be more negative impacts, like the possibility that the end user does not support JS or certain browsers do not support your script.</p>

<p>Regardless the data will most likely make up the bulk of your result from what it sounds.  The more important thing to decide is whether or not you will be using divs or a table, if the data is something that needs to be presented in a tabular manner, than use a table, otherwise avoid it at all costs.  Having 1 div and some line breaks instead of a ton of tables/rows and cells would be a drastic reduction in load time comparatively.</p>

<p>It does depend exactly what you're doing though.</p>

<p>It's not an answer rather asking a question to your experience. I also use complex types to pass them to url string but found that they are not always render as desired. 
To solve this problem I do use overriden <code>ToString</code> method of passed complex type. It works but I don't like that solution - it looks ugly for me and I already asked a question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3061430/how-to-convert-model-into-url-properly-in-asp-net-mvc">here</a> but got no answer. Could you explain please how have you resolved such issue?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm having some trouble displaying the time in this format: HH:mm:ss.
No matter what i try, i never get it in that format.</p>

<p>I want the time in the culture of the Netherlands which is "nl-NL".</p>

<p>This was one of my (although i forgot to keep the count) 1000th try:</p>

<pre><code>CultureInfo ci = new CultureInfo("nl-NL");

string s = DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay.ToString("HH:mm:ss", ci);
</code></pre>

<p>What am i doing wrong?</p>

<p>Use the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/error/" rel="nofollow"><code>error</code></a> handler like this:</p>

<pre><code>$('#image_id').error(function() {
  alert('Image does not exist !!');
});
</code></pre>

<p>If the image cannot be loaded (for example, because it is not present at the supplied URL), the alert is displayed:</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>I think using:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({url:'somefile.dat',type:'HEAD',error:do_something});
</code></pre>

<p>would be enough to check for a 404.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>Your code should be like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(this).error(function() {

</code></pre>

<p>No need for these lines and that won't check if the remote file exists anyway:</p>

<pre><code>var imgcheck = imgsrc.width;    

if (imgcheck==0) {
  alert("You have a zero size image");
} else { //do rest of code }

<p>From <a href="http://jqueryfordesigners.com/image-loading/" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code>// when the DOM is ready

  var img = new Image();

  // wrap our new image in jQuery, then:
  $(img)
    // once the image has loaded, execute this code
    .load(function () {
      // set the image hidden by default    
      $(this).hide();

      // with the holding div #loader, apply:
      $('#loader')
        // remove the loading class (so no background spinner), 
        .removeClass('loading')
        // then insert our image
        .append(this);

      // fade our image in to create a nice effect
      $(this).fadeIn();
    })

    // if there was an error loading the image, react accordingly
    .error(function () {
      // notify the user that the image could not be loaded

    // *finally*, set the src attribute of the new image to our image

<p>When I trying to run Ant — he show me an alert with “Project JDK not specified”. How I can use Ant in Intellij Idea for web-applications without JDK?</p>

<p>My answer assumes you are building a web app that is not targeted at low-end browsers.</p>

<p>In this case, definitely client side. Even if you have 1000s of rows. Send them over in JSON (lower bandwidth req.), then render the table using jQuery, but don't display them all at once. That'll kill your browser. Use paging, sorting and search creatively to establish an optimal user experience.
If you have to deal with hundreds or thousands of rows, use <a href="http://github.com/danstocker/jorder" rel="nofollow">jOrder</a> for search, sorting and paging to keep things fast.</p>

<p>What is the best way to load content into my infowindow using ajax?
Right now I am getting a similar effect using iframes but I am not that that happy with it.
I thought this would be straight forward but its confusing me for some reason. 
This is how its working right now:</p>

<pre><code>var markers = [];
  var infowindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow();
  $.each(JSON.parse(aulas), function(i, a){

    var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng(a.aula.lat, a.aula.lng);
    var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
      position : latlng,
      title: a.aula.title
    });

    google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {
      infowindow.close();
      infowindow.setContent("&lt;div class='infowindow_content'&gt;&lt;iframe src='aulas/show/" + a.aula.id + "'&gt;&lt;/iframe&lt;/div&gt;");

      infowindow.open(map, marker);
    });
    markers.push(marker);
  });
</code></pre>

<p>It would be easy to grab the content via ajax just before the infowindow.setContent call, but I want to make the ajax call only when the infowindow opens. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>BTW: I am using jQuery.</p>

<p>As was suggested in the answer I decided to move the calls to setContent and open to a separate function. For those interested the code that solved this was:</p>

<pre><code>function load_content(marker, id){
  $.ajax({
    url: 'aulas/show/' + id,
    success: function(data){
      infowindow.setContent(data);
      infowindow.open(map, marker);
    }
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then change the listener:</p>

<pre><code>    google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {
      infowindow.close();
      load_content(marker, a.aula.id);
    });
    markers.push(marker);
  });
</code></pre>

<p>When you want to generate random value from range <code>[0, x)</code>, instead of doing <code>rand()%x</code>, you should apply formula <code>x*((double)rand()/RAND_MAX)</code>, which will give you nicely distributed random values.</p>

<p>Say, RAND_MAX is equal to 15, so <code>rand</code> will give you integers from 0 to 15. When you use modulo operator to get random numbers from <code>[0, 10)</code>, values <code>[0,5]</code> will have higher frequency than <code>[6,9]</code>, because <code>3 == 3%10 == 13%10</code>.</p>

<p>Hi,
Does anyone know about free VNC viewer except TightVNC and UltraVNC?
TIA</p>

<p>Like most questions of this form, the question is basically pointless. It's not like the designers of Java and C# had a meeting about it. Historically Java came first so you would really have to ask the designers of C#, not that the question would necessarily make sense to them either. It's just how they saw it at the time.</p>

<p>You can still use lists, by adding the "display: inline-block" to li elements themselves</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Gallery&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;style type="text/css" media="screen"&gt;
    body {
        text-align: center;
    }
    ul {
        padding: 0;
        list-style-type: none;
        width:100%;
    }
    li {
        width: 200px;
        display:inline-block;
        background-color: violet;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;thumbnail&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;thumbnail&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;thumbnail&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;thumbnail&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;thumbnail&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;thumbnail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;thumbnail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;​​​​​
&lt;/html&gt;

<p>There are a number of ways of reducing DNS load time with different host names.  One trick is to have the other host names in the AR section of the DNS response; for example, if someone asks for a.example.com, we can helpfully tell them the DNS hostnames for b.example.com, c.example.com, d.example.com, and so on as additional records in the DNS reply, when giving them the IP for a.example.com in the answer.  </p>

<p>This will pre-cache the answers for all of those other host names with some, but not all, recursive DNS servers (for security reasons, this trick doesn't work for either of the recursive DNS servers I have implemented, since, for security reasons, they do not blindly cache records in the AR section of a DNS reply).  </p>

<p>Another trick to minimize DNS lookups is to have all of the names in the same domain (have all names end in, for example, example.com: a.example.com, b.example.com, etc.), make sure no glueless records need to be followed to resolve the names (make your NS records have names like ns1.example.com and ns2.example.com, and don't use any CNAME entries), and, if your servers do not change IPs very often, have a large TTL for the DNS entries for your servers. </p>

<p>If you use a group function like <code>SUM</code> in a statement containing no GROUP BY clause, <strong>it is equivalent to grouping on all rows</strong>.</p>

<p>and  That's why you get only one row in results</p>

<pre><code>GROUP BY events.event_id

<p>Hey.  </p>

<p>Powershell will give you advantage if you need to manipulate something else than a browser/webpage/webapp. With Powershell you can do something with OS, applications, things outside the browser.  </p>

<p>If you don't need to do that, if you want to automate only web based app, than I would suggest using web specific tool. Selenium is nice, tests in MSVS2010 are great. If you prefer coding try <a href="http://watin.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">WatiN</a> for .net, and <a href="http://watij.com/" rel="nofollow">WatiJ</a> for java. All of them will run smoothly not only inside IDE, but also on CI server.</p>

<p>If you don't want to use additional files, put your template as a separate sheet in the same XLS where your macro resides. IMHO, you should avoid having to recreate a complete sheet by code, at least for maintenance reasons.</p>

<p>That is why you should consider not using a VCS (Version Control System), like Git (which is a DVCS) or any other VCS for packaging and release management.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3329041/best-practice-to-store-jar-files-in-vcs-svn-git/3329272#3329272">Best practice to store .jar files in VCS (SVN, Git, …)</a>.</p>

<p>An external artifact repository like <strong><a href="http://nexus.sonatype.org/" rel="nofollow">Nexus</a></strong> is more adapted, especially when it comes to clean up and remove the old packaged versions of your software.</p>

<hr>

<p>I don't see how you can change anything in the Git history of your repo <em>while</em> preserving the link between said repo and your RedMine system: any change will trigger a new SHA1 reference.</p>

<p>Also consider garbage collection as a possible reason for this. You might track down things using jvisualvm, and switch to the concurrent collector.</p>

<p>What is the difference between this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo {
    private Bar bar;
    public Foo() { bar = new Bar(); }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo {
    private Bar bar = new Bar();
    public Foo() { }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hi, I have troubles with deploying lift application with uses enterprise java beans. There's a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>@Stateless
class TestEJB {
 def a = "hello"
}

object TestApi extends XMLApiHelper{
 @EJB
 private var bean:TestEJB = _
 def createTag(a:NodeSeq) = 
 def dispatch: LiftRules.DispatchPF = {
  case Req("test" :: Nil, "", GetRequest) =>
   () => PlainTextResponse( bean.a )
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>There's NullPointerException on line with <code>bean.a</code>, so that means, that the <code>bean</code> haven't been initialized well. Why?</p>

<pre><code>string s = DateTime.Now.ToString("HH:mm:ss");
</code></pre>

<p>Look at my reply to question</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3109158/how-to-draw-a-path-on-a-map-using-kml-file/3109723#3109723">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3109158/how-to-draw-a-path-on-a-map-using-kml-file/3109723#3109723</a></p>

<p>and there especially into the RouteOverlay class / draw method. 
Since you only want to draw a simple straight line, you probably won't need the rest of the complexity there.</p>

<p>The difference is that in the second case field initialization happens before this/base constructor while in the first case initialization happens inside the constructor.</p>

<p>I have a div with text inside of it. I want the text to be selectable (for copy/paste) on the iPad. At the same time I want to be able to handle an onclick event.
This seems not to go well together. As soon the div is clickable it is not selectable. </p>

<p>Does anybody know a way around this?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;

function run() {

    // do some stuff here...
}


 &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;!-- removing this onclick makes the div selectable --&gt;
  &lt;div onclick="run()"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;AAA aaaa aaaa aaaa&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;bbbbb bbbb BBBBB&lt;/p&gt;   
  &lt;div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

<p>Meanwhile I found a solution to the problem: The SQL-dialect was wrong, someone set it to Oracle9 instead of the correct version, which is this:</p>

<p>name="hibernate.dialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect" </p>

<p>Setting the correct SQL-dialect solves the problem :-)</p>

<p>"Ping " always performs a DNS lookup (both forward and reverse) before pinging the hostname in question.  Writing a shell script to use ping (or dig) to see if ping is acting wonky is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>Another option is to use a caching DNS server on the local machine that caches replies from the upstream DNS server, and sends data from the cache when upstream is down.  My own Deadwood is a tiny 32k Windows or UNIX binary that can do this (64k if you want full DNS recursion)</p>

<p>I'm doing a simple program using arraylist. But I've encountered an error. 
After deleting an element in the arraylist, using this code:</p>

intdelnum=Integer.parseInt(delnum);

nem.remove(intdelnum);
corz.remove(intdelnum);
skul.remove(intdelnum);
gen.remove(intdelnum);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm having problems with adding another record after a delete. From what I see, the index, where I'm storing the next element is greater than the size, since I deleted an item.</p>

<pre><code>do {
    System.out.println("Add Records");

    System.out.print("Name: ");
    nem.add(ctr, scanz.nextLine());

    System.out.print("Course: ");
    corz.add(ctr, scanz.nextLine());

    System.out.print("Gender: ");
    gen.add(ctr, scanz.nextLine());

    System.out.print("School: ");
    skul.add(ctr, scanz.nextLine());

    System.out.println("Another?\n1.Yes\n2.No");
    adds=scanz.nextLine();
    addagain=Integer.parseInt(adds);

    ctr++;
} while(addagain==1);

<p>With this when i press continue it should send ajax call, but it doesn't. When i press Continue it just takes me to the form´s action="index.php?page=checkin", even if theres return false; on click(in the script)? I even tried to change the form line and inserted onsubmit="return false;" but then nothing happens at all when i click on the button.</p>

<p>Hello I have a text file with three lines. every line has a float number.
How can I take each value and put in a float variable even if array?</p>

<p>For example text file is like the following</p>

<pre><code>+3.01\n
-0.0012\n
-0.1\n
</code></pre>

<p>I want an array [if it possible] which save the values as float not as string.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You should use event handlers for iOS web interaction:</p>

<pre><code>// Replace "document" with the element you want it to apply
// to through getElementById("anId")

document.addEventListener("touchstart", run, false);
</code></pre>

<p>This will call run() when a touch has started.</p>

<p>The default methods of onclick, onmousedown, etc. behave weirdly on iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.</p>

<p>I haven't looked at PHP in a very long time, but if you can make web service calls from it then try <a href="http://blog.muhimbi.com/2009/12/converting-office-files-to-pdf-format.html" rel="nofollow">this product</a>.

<p>Stating the obvious a bit, but with the second approach there's no need for a constructor.</p>

<p>SQL Server's syntax for reading XML is one of the least intuitive around.  Ideally, you'd want to:</p>

<pre><code>select   f.name
from     friends f
join     @xml x
on       x.id = f.id
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, SQL Server requires you to spell out everything.  To turn an XML variable or column into a "rowset", you have to spell out the exact path and think up two aliases:</p>

<pre><code>@xml.nodes('/root/id') as table_alias(column_alias)
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have to explain to SQL Server how to turn <code>&lt;id&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;</code> into an int:</p>

<pre><code>table_alias.column_alias.value('.', 'int')
</code></pre>

<p>So you can see why most people prefer to decode XML on the client side :)</p>

<p>A full example:</p>

<pre><code>declare @friends table (id int, name varchar(50))
insert @friends (id, name)
          select  2, 'Locke Lamorra'
union all select  6, 'Calo Sanzo'
union all select 10, 'Galdo Sanzo'
union all select 14, 'Jean Tannen'

declare @xml xml
set @xml = ' &lt;root&gt;&lt;id&gt;2&lt;/id&gt;&lt;id&gt;6&lt;/id&gt;&lt;id&gt;14&lt;/id&gt;&lt;/root&gt;'

select  f.name
from    @xml.nodes('/root/id') as table_alias(column_alias)
join    @friends f
on      table_alias.column_alias.value('.', 'int') = f.id
</code></pre>

<p>One option is to have the DNS server quickly answer any requests to convert an IP in to a hostname with a "this IP has no hostname" responses.  MaraDNS 1.x supports this via "reject_ptr"; I could add this capability to Deadwood (MaraDNS 2.0) in about 10 minutes if there was demand for it.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like a typo and it looks like in your data field.</p>

<p>I would suggest doing </p>

<pre><code>data: "value1="+$("#val1").val()+"&amp;value2="+$("#val2").val() 
</code></pre>

<p>Also a good way to debug javascript is to open up chrome's console or in firefox use firebugs console and when you perform the action it will usually inform you of a problem or lack thereof.</p>

<p>One last note: I would suggest using json in your return from php, this way you can provide user with a more catered message.  For example, lets say your form doesnt validate server side (you are validating server side right?) you can return to client a nice message explaining to them waht did not validate.  How to do this? </p>

<pre><code>  $.ajax({
           type: "POST",
           url: "dbc.php",
           data: "val1="+$(#val1).val()+"&amp;val2="+$(#val2).val(), 
           success: function(json){
               if(json.error){
                  //notify user of error message
                  $(#statusDiv).(json.message); 
               }else{
                  //perform success 

               }               
            }
         });
</code></pre>

<p>And on the server side to use something such as </p>

<pre><code>echo json_encode(array("error"=&gt;1, "message"=&gt;"&lt;insert validation problems here&gt;")); 
</code></pre>

<p>This will on success function have access via json.error, or json.message. </p>

<p>Hello everyone. I am building a complex HTML 5 application that takes advantage of Websockets. I am getting to the point where I have a lot of different types of data that gets updated in real time on the screen. </p>

<p>I want to know if it is going to be better for me to have fewer Websockets that are more complex, or a lot of simple Websockets open per page. </p>

<p>I added <a href="http://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket</a> web socket server to my Grails Application. </p>

<p>Right now I am going down the path of using a lot of simple web sockets for each task. I know using more sockets will use more memory on the server side but also more sockets means more concurrent processing. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice on how I can balance this.</p>

<p>Thanks for any tips in advance. Keith Blanchard </p>

<p>I developed a simple web servie using restlets . everything s fine i can call a URI and connect to db and do modifications , but when i tried to do the same using jsp s i was not able to get the jsp page itself in the browser . How can i connect a jsp page to this restlet ?</p>

<p>Possibly something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="button" value="SUBMIT" onclick="validateFunction()"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your <code>validateFunction</code>, at the end if it is all good to go then call <code>document.form.submit()</code> which will process your loading dialog and send the form.</p>

<p>Also, as a side note, since you stated you are using jquery for validation, with your current setup a person with javascript disabled could still submit invalid data (causing all sorts of drop tables and whatnot). With this method (the submit being called within the script), they won't be able to send AT ALL.</p>

<p>Another route is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="submit" onclick="validateFunction();return false;"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And at the end of your validate function set it to return(true/false) if it is okay to send or not. THEN re-validate on the server side, using PHP or whatever and return an error if any problems. This allows users without javascript to still attempt to send but not have them destroy your site. </p>

<p>First off, I would like to make a few points I believe to be true. Please can these be verified?</p>

<ul>
<li>A hash map stores strings by
converting them into an integer
somehow. </li>
<li>std::map is not a hash map, and if I'm using strings, I should consider using a hash map for memory issues?</li>
<li>String compares are not good to rely on.</li>
</ul>

<p>If std::map is not a hash map and I should not be relying on string compares (basically, I have a map with strings as keys...I was told to look up using hash maps instead?), is there a hash map in the C++ STL? If not, how about Boost?</p>

<p>Secondly, Is a hash map worth it for [originally] an <code>std::map&lt; std::string, non-POD GameState &gt;</code>?</p>

<p>I think my point is getting across...I plan to have a store of different game states I can look up and register into a factory.
If any more info is needed, please ask.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>I want to learn Ocaml or Haskell and I want to do it by writing a simple game. Apparently, there's one small problem: nobody cares about Windows and I want to do it on Windows, natively.</p>

<p>Haskell has Cabal, which has SDL, but it doesn't build due to a trivial problem with no workarounds (order of parameters passed to gcc). Ocaml doesn't even have that, it's all in source packages, be it GLCaml or OcamlSDL or whatever.</p>

<p>Is there a place where I can get a working SDL for Haskell or Ocaml on Windows without fighting with a dozen versions of compilers?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have a UIImageView *picture</p>

<p>and a UIButton *next</p>

<p>and an - (IBAction)next {
}</p>

<p>I want to change the image on the view but only if the image equals... for example img1</p>

<p>But using the same button I want to also be able to change the picture if the image = img2 but to a different image (img3)</p>

<p>So far I have this code but it gives me errors please could you help:</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)next {
    if (picture UIImage = imageNamed:@"img01.jpg") {
    [picture setImage: [UIImage imageNamed:@"img02.jpg"
    }
    if (picture UIImage = imageNamed:@"img02.jpg") {
    [picture setImage: [UIImage imageNamed:@"img03.jpg"
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Please help </p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Will</p>

<p>You should just use <code>add(object)</code> rather than <code>add(index, object)</code> - then you won't have the problem you've encoutered above.</p>

<p>Wow! Thanks Bryan, this solved my issue too :)</p>

<p>What about</p>

<p>I've been bashing my head on this for a while, so now I'm here :)  I'm a SQL beginner, so maybe this will be easy for you guys...</p>

GROUP BY subscribe_date  
ORDER BY subscribe_date  
</code></pre>

<p>Now the dates I've shown above are hard coded, my application will supply a variable date range.</p>

<p>Right now I'm getting a result table where there is a value for that date.  </p>

<pre><code>counter |recur | subscribe_date   
2    |    Monthly | 2010-07-18  
3    |    Monthly | 2010-07-19  
4    |    Monthly | 2010-07-20    
6    |    Monthly | 2010-07-22
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to return in the counter column if the date doesn't exist.</p>

<pre><code>counter |recur | subscribe_date   
0    |    Monthly | 2010-07-16  
0    |    Monthly | 2010-07-17

6    |    Monthly | 2010-07-22  
0    |    Monthly | 2010-07-23 
</code></pre>

<p>Is this possible?</p>

<p>You probably don't have the appropriate server in /etc/resolv.conf if you're using a UNIX (as opposed to a Windows) system.  There are numerous ports of Dig to Windows; if using Windows please RTFM (or, if needed, UTSL) to see how they get their default servers.</p>

<p>By the way, I want to split that XLST parts with XLS files. I tried with the <code>&lt;xsl:include&gt;</code> but I can't get it working with the param $menu.</p>

<p>I've marqued with <em>Split</em> and <em>End Split</em> where I need to split the document</p>

<p>I already tried to solve with the first reply by @svick, but splitting it with the marks I've done the XSLTPRocessor class for PHP gives me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Warning: XSLTProcessor::importStylesheet() [xsltprocessor.importstylesheet]: element import only allowed as child of stylesheet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, something is wrong with splitting in the way I'm doing and then including it. </p>

<p>How can I solve it?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>hi every body I'm trying to open an image in a new window ,using javascript, by clicking on a button, then set a class to the image, using this code:</p>

<pre><code>    OpenWindow=window.open("", "newwin","height=100,width=1000"); 
    OpenWindow.document.write("&lt;img id='img1' src='webfonts.jpg'&gt;");
    OpenWindow.document.getElementById("img1").className = "larger";
    OpenWindow.document.close();
</code></pre>

<p>and this is the internal style I have included in my code in a style tag:
.larger{ width:10px; }
and in the body tag 
1:I have include my image source by an img tag
2:make a button tag with an onclick=larger() attribute</p>

<p>but unfortunately I have a problem with last sentence, the class is not assigned at all to the image.
 I have tried to use classname also instead of setttribute but it generates the same result. 
any ideas?
thx </p>

<p>Hi I am developing an Android App where I require a user to authenticate his session before using the app. One way is to store a user name and password by asking him to register on the app and then use that to authenticate him. But i was looking to do something else, maybe use an OpenId account to authenticate or Opensoial or something like Facebook Connect. Any Suggestions and comments? thanks for you help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have a table called 'business' with the following sample data:</p>

<pre><code>Street - 150 N Michigan Ave.
City - Chicago
State - IL
Zip - 60601
</code></pre>

<p>When I run a query like</p>

<pre><code>SELECT business.* 
    WHERE MATCH(business.Street, business.City, business.State, business.Zip)
                AGAINST('*150*' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
-- IT WORKS


SELECT business.* 
    WHERE MATCH(business.Street, business.City, business.State, business.Zip)
                AGAINST('*Chicago*' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
-- IT WORKS


SELECT business.* 
    WHERE MATCH(business.Street, business.City, business.State, business.Zip)
                AGAINST('*60601*' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
-- IT WORKS


SELECT business.* 
    WHERE MATCH(business.Street, business.City, business.State, business.Zip)
                AGAINST('*IL*' IN BOOLEAN MODE)
-- DOESNT WORK!!
</code></pre>

<p>So what's wrong with the last query?</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>I don't most of your points are correct. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>there is no hash map in the current standard. C++0x introduces unordered_map, who's implementation will be a hash table and your compiler probably already supports it.</p></li>
<li><p>std::map is implemented as a balanced tree, not  a hash table. There are no "memory issues" when using either map type with strings, either as keys or data.</p></li>
<li><p>strings are not stored as numbers in either case - an unordered_map will use a hashing function to derive a numeric key from the string, but this is not stored.</p></li>
<li><p>my experience is that unordered_map is about twice the speed of  map - they have basically the same interface, so you can try both with your own data - whenever you are interested in performance you should always perform tests your self with your own real data, rather than  depending on the experience of others. Both map types will be somewhat sensitive to the length of the string key.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming you have some class A, that you want to access via a string key, the maps would be declared as:</p>

<pre><code>map &lt;string, A&gt; amap;
unordered_map &lt;string, A&gt; umap;
</code></pre>

<p>What will be the query so i can find that is 08-Oct-10 Exist for 1000058 in table </p>

<pre><code>SELECT Schedule_ID 
FROM TBL_SCHEDULE 
WEHRE CARD_NO = 1000058 AND .......... (WHAT MORE)
</code></pre>

<p>Like this query must result Schedule_ID = 6 because this date 08-Oct-10 is in range of Schedule_ID = 6.</p>

<p>Anybody can provide code snippet how to implement something like "SEO Smart Links" does ?</p>

<p>Here is what it does:  SEO Smart Links can automatically link keywords and phrases in your posts and comments with corresponding posts, pages, categories and tags on your blog.</p>

<p>So e.g. I will provide array of keywords + links, pass it to the function and function must search for those words in post and then replace them and create links.</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)next {
    if ([[picture image] isEqual: [UIImage imageNamed:@"img01.jpg"]]) {

       [picture setImage: [UIImage imageNamed:@"img02.jpg"]];

    } else if ([[picture image] isEqual: [UIImage imageNamed:@"img02.jpg"]]) {

       [picture setImage: [UIImage imageNamed:@"img03.jpg"]];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, this is a pretty rudimentary way of changing the image.  A more elegant way would be to have a global <code>int</code> that had the current image index, so clicking "next" would simply increase that count.  Then, if an image exists with that name, switch to it:</p>

<p>// Declare index in Header.h</p>

<pre><code>index=0;

- (IBAction)next {
    index++;
    // Set imageCount to as many images as are available
    int imageCount=2;
    if (index&lt;=imageCount) {
        NSString* imageName=[NSString stringWithFormat:@"img%02i", index];
        [picture setImage: [UIImage imageNamed: imageName]];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>$fileArr = file($fileName);

<p>I have two tables:</p>

<pre><code>regions &lt;id&gt;
points &lt;region_id, x, y&gt;

<pre><code>rectangular_regions &lt;region_id, x1, y1, x2, y2&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>?</p>

<p>How about:</p>

<pre><code>WHILE @Id IS NOT NULL AND @Id &lt;&gt; @AncestorId
BEGIN
 SET @Id = (
  SELECT ManagerId FROM dbo.Users WHERE UserId = @Id
 )
END

RETURN CASE WHEN @Id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END

<p>A hash map will typically have some integral representation of a string, yes.  </p>

<p>std::map has a requirement to be sorted, so implementing it as a hash table is unlikely, and I've never seen it in practice.  </p>

<p>Whether string comparisons are good or bad depends entirely on what you're doing, what data you're comparing, and how often. If the first letter differs then that's barely any different from an integer comparison, for example.</p>

<p>You want <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_39_0/doc/html/boost/unordered_map.html" rel="nofollow">unordered_map</a> (that's the Boost version - there is also a version in the TR1 standard library if your compiler has that).</p>

<p>Is it worth it for game states? Yes, but only because using an unordered_map is simple. You're prematurely worrying about optimisations at this stage. Save the worries over access patterns for things you're going to look up thousands of times a second (ie. when your profiler tells you that it's a problem).</p>

<p>How do I create a reusable library/module in XCode 3.2? What I want to do is create a bunch of classes that provide certain functionality compile them into some kind of library, add such a library to an existing xcode project and use the classes in it.
I come from .NET world so what I want to do is basically to create an equivalent of 'assembly' and  then reference it somehow in my XCode project.
I am developing for iOS btw.</p>

<p>The problem is it's doing the default action, because none of your jQuery code is running :)  When your code runs, the <code>id="continue"</code> element isn't there yet, so <code>$("#continue")</code> doesn't find anything to bind a <code>click</code> handler to.  It's an easy fix, wrap your code in a <code>document.ready</code> call, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
  $("#continue").click(function () {
    $.ajax({
       type: "POST",
       url: "dbc.php?check=First",
       data: {full_name : $('#full_name').val()
             usr_email : $('#usr_email').val()},
       success: function(msg){
           if(msg==1){
              $("#First_1").hide();
              $("#Next_2").toggle(); 
           }else{
              alert(msg)
           }               
        }
     });
     return false;
  });
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>By doing this it'll wait until the DOM is ready, and your elements are there to find/bind to.  Also instead of attaching to the <code>#continue</code> button's <code>click</code> event, it's usually better to attach to the form's <code>submit</code> handler, so it's caught there, so instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>$("#continue").click(function () {
</code></pre>

<p>You would do this:</p>

<pre><code>$("form[name='regForm']").submit(function() {
</code></pre>

<p>With everything else staying the same.</p>

<p>TimeOfDay is a TimeSpan, which has only one ToString() without parameters.
Use Darin's solution or a sample from MSDN documentation for TimeSpan.ToString() </p>

<pre><code>SELECT Schedule_ID 
FROM TBL_SCHEDULE 
WHERE CARD_NO = 1000058 
  AND yourDate BETWEEN FromDate AND ToDate
</code></pre>

<p>As I see you Ctr gets increased after every time you insert an item. but not get decreased after deletion. So, next time you when you go to add an item to these lists the index represents by ctr does not exist in the list. This is the reason for you to get IndexOutOfBoundException.</p>

<p>By using ctr-- in deletion, as "the Duckman" said, solves the your existing problem. But "Will A"'s approach simplifies the code. As Osccam's Razor suggest I like to go with "Will A"'s answer</p>

<p>If you want mostly to launch control panel you can do using RunDll32 interface existing in the most control panel applets. See <a href="http://www.osattack.com/windows-7/huge-list-of-windows-7-shell-commands/" rel="nofollow">http://www.osattack.com/windows-7/huge-list-of-windows-7-shell-commands/</a> , <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167012" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/167012</a> or <a href="http://www.winvistaclub.com/t57.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.winvistaclub.com/t57.html</a> for example. For the corresponding API see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/164787" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/164787</a>.</p>

<p>Another option is usage of control.exe (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144191.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144191.aspx</a> and <a href="http://vlaurie.com/computers2/Articles/control.htm" rel="nofollow">http://vlaurie.com/computers2/Articles/control.htm</a>).</p>

<p>If you google more you will find much more examples which you can to automate a lot of things <strong>without</strong> using of some general ways to automate GUI. </p>

<p>On a side note, you will also want to include in this new page some css otherwise this class="larger" will not do anything. </p>

<pre><code>OpenWindow.document.write('&lt;html&gt;&lt;link href="css/style.css"/&gt;&lt;body&gt;');
OpenWindow.document.write('&lt;img src="{source URL}" id="img1" class="larger" /&gt;');
OpenWindow.document.write('&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;');
</code></pre>

FROM points 
GROUP BY region_id.

<p>Hello. I will begin by saying that I'm 15 years old and from Sweden, so please excuse my English.</p>

<p>I'm reading a book called Beginning iPhone 3 Developement - Exploring the iPhone SDK, by Dave Mark and Jeff LaMarche. I've read about navigation controllers and multiview applications, and now I want to create my own little app, a very simple Twitter app. I want a login view, and if the login is successful I want the user to be presented a view with a tab bar, where each tab is Update, Timeline and such. Right now I'm just going for the update view.</p>

<p>So I thought about a navigation-based app. The first view, the login view, is on the bottom of the stack. When the user logs in, the view with the tab bar is pushed on to the stack. Then the user does whatever (s)he wants there, in the tabs. (S)he should then be able to press some kind of logout button, which pops the tab bar view off the stack, and takes the user back to the login view.</p>

<p>Now to my question (sorry for my long explanation): is this the way to go? If so, how do I do it? Do I create a view controller called LoginViewController, which is subclassing UINavigationController, or what?</p>

<p>To me a more general way is via a monad/comonad pair.  This generalizes the common "monad" approach which should correctly be called the "strong monad" approach, since it only works with strong monads.</p>

<p>Moving to a monad/comonad pair allows effects to be modeled that result in some variables no longer being available.  An example where this is useful is the effect of migrating a thread to another host in a distributed setting.</p>

<p>An additional method of historical interest is to make the whole program a function mapping a stream/list of input events to a stream/list of output events.  See: "How to Declare an Imperative" by Phil Wadler: <a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/~wadler/topics/monads.html#monadsdeclare" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/~wadler/topics/monads.html#monadsdeclare</a></p>

<p>Trying to read a binary data file in the assets directory of android app:</p>

<pre><code>void loadFile(InputStream filein){

  log(filein.available()); // returns 11310099

  int a = filein.read(); // returns -1 (i.e. EOF)
}

// Function was called using:
loadFile(context.getAssets().open("filename.dat"));
</code></pre>

<p>So if available() correctly returns that there is 11MB of data available in the filehandle, how can read() immediately return -1 as soon as I try to read the first byte?</p>

<p>It is certainly possible to do this and I'm certain that I've seen someone already write a plugin for it, I just can't seem to remember where it was. </p>

<p>To get you started on the plugin route, you need to decide what the plugin should do and following that, wha the options should be.</p>

<p>So far, we know that the plugin needs to -</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Zoom in on mouseenter</strong><br>
  How much should it zoom?<br>
  Should the image remain centered throughout the zoom?<br>
  At what speed should the image zoom?  </li>
<li><strong>Zoom out on mouseleave</strong><br>
  using the same settings for speed as Zoom in.<br>
  should return back to the original image size.</li>
</ol>

<p>With these in mind, things you need to think about.</p>

<ol>
<li>If we simply increase the width and height of an image, the width and height will grow in the viewport, but what we really want to do is constrain the width and height to what it is on page load and have the image become larger within those bounds. How might we go about this?</li>
<li>When we zoom, should we swap out the source of the zoomed image file for a higher resolution version of the image? We might not need to do this for small zooms, say 10 - 20%, but may want to do this for larger zoom percentages.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Some code to get you started. Run this on this page and observe what happens to the images</p>

<pre><code>var imgs = $('img');
imgs.wrap('&lt;div style="overflow:hidden;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');

imgs.parent('div').each(function() {
  var self = $(this),
      img = self.find('img');
  self.height(img.height());
  self.width(img.width());
});

imgs.animate({ width: "+=10%", height: "+=10%"}, 2000);
</code></pre>

<p>Subclass <code>UIImageView</code> and add a <code>enum</code> property in the header:</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum _PictureType {
    PictureTypeFirstImage = 0,
    PictureTypeSecondImage,
    PictureTypeThirdImage,
    PictureTypes
} PictureType;

@interface MyImageView : UIImageView {
    PictureType type;
}

@property (readwrite) PictureType type;
</code></pre>

<p>In the implementation:</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize type;

<p>I have had something like this happen. A few things you can check:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check you have added the new image files to your project.</li>
<li>Delete the app from your device/simulator and re-build/re-run</li>
<li>NSLog the filenames and check your are using the images you think you are.</li>
</ul>

<p>To plot the red 'X', you have to call first <code>hold on</code> to make sure that the second plotting command won't erase the contour. Then, you use <code>plot(xMax,yMax,'xr')</code> to plot a red 'x' at the x/y coordinates where z is at its maximum.</p>

<p>To find <code>xMax</code> and <code>yMax</code>, you have to use the second output argument of <code>max</code>. <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/max.html" rel="nofollow">MAX</a> returns, as first output, the maximum (e.g. of <code>Z</code>), and as a second output, it returns the number of the element that is maximal. Use that number (the index) to find the elements in <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> that correspond to the maximum <code>Z</code>-value, i.e. <code>xMax</code> and <code>yMax</code>.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I would like to "extend" my domain classes without having to add data to the domain classes themselves. Concider I have the following class:</p>

<p>public class Person<br>
{<br>
    public virtual int Id { get; private set; }<br>
    public virtual string Name { get; set; }<br>
}</p>

<p>And I have the following table in the database:</p>

<p>tblPersons<br>---------------<br>
Id integer <br>
Name varchar(50)<br>
CreatedBy varchar(50)<br>
CreatedDate datetime</p>

<p>So I don't want to add "CreatedBy" and "CreatedDate" to my domain class, because this has nothing to do with the actual domain itself...</p>

<p>Would it be possible to get this data whenever I load an entity? I would like to use it like this:</p>

<p>Person person = session.Load(1);</p>

<p>person.CreatedBy(); &lt;-- CreatedBy is an Extension function<br>
person.CreatedDate(); &lt;-- CreatedDate is an Extension function<br></p>

<p><b>Can anyone point me in which direction to go in order to implement this? </b></p>

<p><b>I have thought about the following possibilities:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Implementa a custom ProxyFactory, where I inject a custom "interface" such as IUpdateable, howver it seems like NHibernate doesn't create the proxies consistently, sometimes it loads a my "proxy class" class, and sometimes it loads the "normal class":</li>
</ul>

<p>Person person = session.Load(2); //this will load my Proxy class of Person just fine</p>

<p><b>Address address = person.Address;</b> //Somehow this doesn't load a Proxy for Address, but instead loads it normally - seems like it's evaluating "ImmediateLoad", which doesn't load proxies, due to lazy loading... not sure how to make this behave as I want.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using a custom PropertyAccessor, I have read something about this - but it seems I must actually map this to a property that EXITS on the domain class... so that wouldn't work right?</p></li>
<li><p>Just as NHibernate "injects" code to the runtime when creating the Proxy classes - perhaps I could do the same but inject the "interface" to the original Person class instead?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Would appreciate any help on this, thank you! :)</p>

<p>There is no difference, because a compiler places all field definitions before constructor's code. So in IL-code both variants look equally.</p>

<p>Hello again stackoverflowians,</p>

<p>I thought it was about time that I learnt how to use a DI framework.  I've heard a lot of good things about Castle Windsor so I decided to go with that.  Now there are PLENTY of tutorials out there on how to use it, however, I cannot find much useful information about what to do when Generics get involved.  Here is my issue.</p>

<p>I have a BaseDAO</p>

<pre><code>namespace Utilities.DataAccess
{
    public class BaseDAO&lt;T&gt; : IBaseDAO&lt;T&gt;
    {
        public BaseDAO(IConnectionProvider _connectionProvider)
        {
           // Stuff
        }
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Im a little bit new to generics in this context and I have seen some tutorials which have a 'BaseDAO' with no generic declaration and simply the interface it implements with the generics on it.  I have used the above way of doing things on many previous projects (without IoC) and its worked fine for me...anyways, onwards to the App.config !</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;configSections&gt;
    &lt;section
      name="castle"
      type="Castle.Windsor.Configuration.AppDomain.CastleSectionHandler, Castle.Windsor"&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/configSections&gt;

  &lt;castle&gt;
    &lt;components&gt;

      &lt;component
        id="BaseDAO"
        service="Utilities.DataAccess.Interfaces.IBaseDAO`1, Utilities.DataAccess"
        type="Utilities.DataAccess.BaseDAO`1, Utilities.DataAccess" /&gt;

      &lt;component
        id="NHibernateConnection"
        service="Utilities.DataAccess.ConnectionProviders.IConnectionProvider, Finchtils"
        type="Utilities.DataAccess.ConnectionProviders.NHibernateConnection" /&gt;

      &lt;component
        id="XMLConnection"
        service="Utilities.DataAccess.ConnectionProviders.IConnectionProvider, Finchtils"
        type="Utilities.DataAccess.ConnectionProviders.XMLConnection, Utilities" /&gt;
    &lt;/components&gt;
  &lt;/castle&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now as some of you may of figured by now, this is a utility library. I intend to use this assembly for each project I create so that I don't have to write the same data access code which remains the same across all solutions.  The implications of such of course is that I cannot tell castle exactly what type parameter I will pass to the BaseDAO,  in one project it might be a Customer object, another entirely different.  I have read on other forums that this is entirely possible as when you request the object from the container you can specify the type then like;</p>

<pre><code>BaseDAO&lt;Customer&gt; baseDao = container.Resolve&lt;BaseDAO&lt;Customer&gt;&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Although it is against my design efforts, I have tried to use the following notation in the App.config</p>

<pre><code>&lt;component
    id="BaseDAO"
    service="Utilities.DataAccess.Interfaces.IBaseDAO`1[[Utilities.DataInterface.IEntity]], Finchtills.DataAccess"
    type="Utilities.DataAccess.BaseDAO`1[[Utilities.DataInterface.IEntity]], Finchtils.DataAccess" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this has not worked either, in any case I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Utilities.Testing.DataAccess.Unit.Testing_BaseDAO (TestFixtureSetUp):
System.Exception : The type name Utilities.DataAccess.BaseDAO`1, Utilities.DataAccess could not be located.
  ----&gt; System.IO.FileNotFoundException : Could not load file or assembly 'Utilities.DataAccess' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
</code></pre>

<p>Reading this error, I <strong>think</strong> it could be one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am missing something from the config file to do with the generics of the types and services.</p></li>
<li><p>I have named something incorrectly I.E an assembly name.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have treated the assembly name as the project that item is contained within, in other words, at no point have i used <code>&lt;solution name&gt;.&lt;project name&gt;.&lt;item folder&gt;.&lt;item name&gt;</code> but merely started at the project level...I assume that any config option would know what solution it is being called from.</p>

<p>Thank you for any help you may be able to give on this subject.</p>

<p>OK, seems this is dupe of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3034615/android-assets-no-value-read">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3034615/android-assets-no-value-read</a> and android is quietly compressing the file in a way that fails at 1MB.  Still, filein.available() should probably return 0 in this case?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have custom server control contains templatefield when an out button clicked the field disappear , when can I rebind the control (inside its class) supposed that Control.Page.OnInit+=new EventHandler(rebind()) doesn't do any things ?</p>

<p>hi . </p>

<p>i have this code in my controller </p>

<pre><code>class Upload_center extends Controller

        if(!$this-&gt;auth_model-&gt;authorize())
        {
            redirect('login');

        } 

    }
</code></pre>

<p>and i have this code in my view </p>

<pre><code>$('#swfupload-control').swfupload({
    upload_url: "&lt;?=base_url()?&gt;index.php/upload_center/upload",

</code></pre>

<p>i want to user upload thier files after login so i have a method needs users to login before proceed to upload files ; although i'm using flash uploader in my view i think it doesn't pass session value and php think user not logged in and redirect him to login page. i send phpsessionid by post but still no goes .  </p>

<p>Another way to see if a given domain exists is to do a NS lookup for the domain in question.  If the domain exists, it must have a NS record, even if the registered nameservers for the domain time out.</p>

<p>Thanks tonclon</p>

<p>That has made a hell of an increase in speed :)</p>

<p>But it still draws in black and white :(</p>

<p>Here is the above code + modifications...</p>

<p>Here is my "static context":</p>

<pre><code>    -(id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder {
    ...
    }
    CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB();
    contextRef = CGBitmapContextCreate(NULL, 
                    320, 
                    640, 
                    8, 
                    320*4, 
                    colorSpace, 
                    kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast);
    CGColorSpaceRelease(colorSpace);

    cglayer = CGLayerCreateWithContext(contextRef, CGSizeMake(320.0f, 640.0f), NULL);
    contextRef = CGLayerGetContext(cglayer);
    ...
    }
</code></pre>

<p>and here is my "replacement context" i.e. the cglayer is used instead (the context is no longer replaced).</p>

<pre><code>-(void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect {
    for(std::vector&lt;Body*&gt;::iterator i = bodyVec.begin(); i &lt; bodyVec.end(); ++i)
        move(i);

    CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();

//  CGContextDrawImage(context, rect, CGBitmapContextCreateImage(contextRef));
    CGContextDrawLayerInRect(context, rect, cglayer);

}
</code></pre>

<p>(The "draw routine's guts" remain the same.)</p>

<p>If you're using the <a href="http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/" rel="nofollow">validation plugin</a> (I'm unclear on this from the question, but it's tagged that way) just move your code around a bit.  Instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() { 
    $('#form').submit(function() { 
        $('#progress').show(); 
    }); 
});
</code></pre>

<p>You'll want to use the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/validate#toptions" rel="nofollow"><code>submitHandler</code> option</a> of the plugin, this function only runs after a form has <em>successfully</em> passed validation and is being submitted, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$("#form").validate({
  //other options...
  submitHandler: function() {
    $('#progress').show(); 
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>This means just remove that first block of code, the <code>submitHandler</code> code is all you should have left for the <code>#progress</code> stuff.</p>

<p>In an HTTP request, headers are key/value pairs separated by a <code>:</code>, so the header pair that you need to send is:</p>

<pre><code>:authorization =&gt; 'UserLogin token="kk5lvKJG1FohVbS3kcHllyTshdcBKX4FpFAKFnx_Eh0IYYpXN3Hg6HZLceXuYt7V52mCcdUk5i_GUMc~"'
</code></pre>

<p>So, to reproduce the request you give in your example:</p>

<pre><code>RestClient.post 'https://api.smarkets.com/v1/users/renew', '', :authorization =&gt; 'UserLogin token="kk5lvKJG1FohVbS3kcHllyTshdcBKX4FpFAKFnx_Eh0IYYpXN3Hg6HZLceXuYt7V52mCcdUk5i_GUMc~"'
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see at <a href="https://ssl.virtualweb.at/redmine/" rel="nofollow">https://ssl.virtualweb.at/redmine/</a> i try to get Redmine up &amp; running.</p>

<p>At the start i got this error:
undefined method `mattr_accessor' for ActiveSupport::Deprecation:Module</p>

<p>Could someone be so nice an give some tipps how to get it to run?</p>

<p>t.i.a.</p>

<p>You will need a table of dates to group against. This is quite easy in MSSQL using CTE's like <a href="http://www.kodyaz.com/articles/sql-server-dates-table-using-tsql-cte-calendar-table.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> - I'm not sure if MySQL has something similar?
Otherwise you will need to create a hard table as a one off exercise</p>

<p>EDIT : Give this a try:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(pp.subscribe_date) AS counter, dl.date, MIN(pp.recur)
FROM date_lookup dl 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN paypal pp 
    on (pp.subscribe_date = dl.date AND pp.recur ='monthly') 
WHERE dl.date &gt;= '2010-07-16' and dl.date &lt;= '2010-07-23'
GROUP BY dl.date
ORDER BY dl.date
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The subject of the query needs to be changed to the date_lookup table
(the order of the Left Outer Join becomes important)</li>
<li>Count(*) isn't going to work since the 'date' record always exists - need to count something in the PayPay table</li>
<li>pp.recur ='monthly' is now a join condition, not a filter because of the LOJ</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, showing pp.recur in the select list isn't going to work. </p>

<p>I've used an aggregate, but MIN(pp.recur) will return null if there are no PayPal records</p>

<p>What you could do when you parameterize your query is to just repeat the Recur Type Filter?
Again, plz excuse the MSSQL syntax</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(pp.subscribe_date) AS counter, dl.date, @ppRecur
FROM date_lookup dl 
    LEFT OUTER JOIN paypal pp 
    on (pp.subscribe_date = dl.date AND pp.recur =@ppRecur) 
WHERE dl.date &gt;= @DateFrom and dl.date &lt;= @DateTo
GROUP BY dl.date
ORDER BY dl.date
</code></pre>

<p>a couple more points</p>

<p>for </p>

<ul>
<li>do not have to administer the Hardware</li>
<li>I guess they take care of security, software updates of the server (Software admin)</li>
<li>saves room. you do not have to find room in your building for a database cluster</li>
</ul>

<p>disadvantages</p>

<ul>
<li>depending on your internet speed, the speed you transfer data can be affected. if the application and data are in the same network you could say that you have 1gbit speed vs a 50mbit internet connection. times this by 1000 concurrent users?</li>
<li>you have to work to their release schedule. if you use a 3rd party and they update the database version which has a breaking change. You will be forced you update. if you host it yourself this upgrade will be under your terms.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have two routes mapped in my MVC application:</p>

<pre><code>public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
    public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
    {
        routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");

    routes.MapRoute(
        "Project",
        "{controller}/{projectid}/{action}/{id}",
        new { controller = "Project", action = "Index", id = "" });

    routes.MapRoute(
        "Default",                                              // Route name
        "{controller}/{action}/{id}",                           // URL with parameters
        new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = "" }  // Parameter defaults
    );

}
</code></pre>

<p>For the most part, these pose no problems, but I do strike trouble when trying to call the /Account/LogOn view.  My ActionLink syntax looks like this (I've tried a couple of variations including null route values and such):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= Html.ActionLink("Log On", "LogOn", "Account") %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Browsing to this view raises a 404 error ("The resource cannot be found").  Ideally I'd like to avoid a huge amount of rework, so what would be the best way to avoid these clashes?</p>

<p>DataType ErrorMessage not work correctly</p>

<p>If I use: </p>

<pre><code>[DataType(DataType.DateTime, ErrorMessage = "The Day is not date"]
public DateTime Day { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>I got the error "The value 'bla-bla-bla'' is not valid for Day." instead of "The Day is not date"</p>

<p>From a UI perspective, a more fluid design might use a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/ModalViewControllers/ModalViewControllers.html" rel="nofollow">modal view controller</a>.</p>

<p>A modal view controller pops up from the bottom of the screen and displays its own view. When this view is dismissed, it shuffles down and disappears. </p>

<p>In my opinion, a modal controller is a good place for a transient authentication screen — you just bring it in view, the user enters his or her info, and the view is dismissed. </p>

<p>On returning to the parent view controller, it checks the authentication credentials and modifies its view if authenticated (or not).</p>

<p>Another advantage of the modal view controller is that it is on its own navigation stack. So you don't need to push a controller, pop up and then push a different view controller. It makes for cleaner code and a cleaner interface (again, in my opinion).</p>

<p>The code looks correct, though you only have the core of the algorithm, not a complete program. You'll have to provide the missing bits: headers, a <code>main</code> function, and a <code>swap</code> macro (you could make <code>swap</code> a function by calling it as <code>swap(s, d, i)</code>).</p>

<p>To understand the algorithm, it would be instructive to add some tracing output, say <code>printf("permute(%s, %d)", s, d)</code> at the beginning of the <code>permute</code> function, and run the program with a 3- or 4-character string.</p>

<p>The basic principle is that each recursive call to <code>permute</code> successively places each remaining element at position <code>d</code>; the element that was at position <code>d</code> is saved by putting it where the aforementioned remaining element was (i.e. the elements are swapped). For each placement, <code>permute</code> is called recursively to generate all desired substrings after the position <code>d</code>. So the top-level call (<code>d</code>=0) to <code>permute</code> successively tries all elements in position 0, second-level calls (<code>d</code>=1) try all elements in position 1 except for the one that's already in position 0, etc. The next-to-deepest calls (<code>d</code>=<code>n</code>-1) have a single element to try in the last position, and the deepest calls (<code>d</code>=<code>n</code>) print the resulting permutation.</p>

<p>The core algorithm requires Θ(n·n!) running time, which is the best possible since that's the size of the output. However this implementation is less efficient that it could be because it recomputes <code>strlen(s)</code> at every iteration, for a Θ(n²·n!) running time; the simple fix of precomputing the length would yield Θ(n·n!). The implementation requires Θ(n) memory, which is the best possible since that's the size of the input.</p>

<p>You will need a table of dates (new table added), and then you will have to do an outer join between that table and your query. </p>

<p>This question is also similar to another question. Answers can be quite similar.</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/373490/insert-dates-in-the-return-from-a-query-where-there-is-none/373734#373734">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/373490/insert-dates-in-the-return-from-a-query-where-there-is-none/373734#373734</a></p>

<p>ok got i working i put </p>

<pre><code>  require_once( '/../../wp-load.php' );
</code></pre>

<p>at the top of the page
and not inside the function</p>

<p>I know that it's strongly recommended to run unit-tests <b>in separation from file system</b>, because if you do touch file system in your test, you also test file system itself. OK, that's reasonable.<br>
My question is, if I want to test file saving to the disk, what do I do? As with database, I separate an interface that is responsible for database access, and then create another implementation of this for my tests? Or may be there's some other way?</p>

<p>Documents module provides security for <strong>LinkClick.aspx</strong> urls that are routed to ASP.NET.</p>

<p>If the actual files reside in the file system under the site's root folder, <strong>direct urls</strong> to these files are served and secured by IIS.
To prevent unauthorized access to direct urls you can disable anonymous authentication and set up Basic authentication with NTFS permissions, for example. </p>

<p>If don't want to touch IIS and administer Windows accounts, you can't store the files directly under any publicly available IIS folder. Security at the ASP.NET application-level is implemented using file encryption or storing the files outside the public IIS folders, like in the database. DNN File Manager offers both of these options: secure folders in the file system and secure folders in the database.</p>

<p>There are also 3rd party modules to manage file security and sharing, like <a href="http://www.snowcovered.com/snowcovered2/Default.aspx?tabid=242&amp;PackageID=16965" rel="nofollow">NukeTransfer</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure from the question what's supposed to be going on, but you have a few issues off the bat.  <code>$("."+mySelected)</code> is a <code>.class</code> selector, not an <code>ID</code> selector. You'll want this to search by ID:</p>

<pre><code> $("#"+mySelected)
</code></pre>

<p>But there's no need for that, just keep a reference, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function($) {
  $(".clickMEdata").click(function(){
    var eleMent = $(this);
    $.ajax({
      type: "POST",
      url: "ScheduleOfManPower.php",
      data: { myID: eleMent.attr("id") },
      success: function(data){
        eleMent.closest('tr').after(data);
      }
    });
    eleMent.toggle("slow");
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This has a few other changes/fixes, you can pass <code>data</code> as an object making that cleaner. If you want to append the returned data you need to use <code>data</code> in your <code>success</code> function, calling <a href="http://api.jquery.com/load/" rel="nofollow"><code>.load()</code></a> will fire another different AJAX request, which doesn't make much sense, but given you're loading it <em>both</em> ways, I'm not sure exactly what you're after...but I <em>think</em> the above is it.</p>

<p>There's one more big change, you were appending a <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> inside an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> which isn't valid at all, I changed it to insert it as the next row.  This one I'm really unsure of, but it's the only thing close that's valid HTML, so please elaborate if it's not what you were after.</p>

<p>I have a file with the following layout:</p>

<pre><code>123,01-08-2006
124,01-09-2007
125,01-10-2009
126,01-12-2010
</code></pre>

<p>How can I convert it into the following by using AWK?</p>

<pre><code>123,2006-08-01
124,2007-09-01
125,2009-10-01

<p>When I refresh a page, browsers retain the scroll position of the page if there is a <code>#</code> in the URL, How to over ride this behavior and scroll to the top of the screen without using JavaScript.</p>

<p>My URL is like <code>http://example.com/#</code></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
By default the URL is <code>http://example.com/</code> and the # character is added to the URL upon clicking some part of the page.</p>

<p>The Haskell Platform comes with a binding to OpenGL which should work out of the box on Windows.</p>

<p>Concerning the SDL package on hackage, you can use <code>cabal unpack SDL</code> to get the source code and fix things yourself. To install the package with your changes, run <code>cabal install</code> in the unpacked directory. In any case, drop a line to the maintainer, I'm sure he'll help out.</p>

<p>Looks like this question has already been answered here --> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/110259/python-memory-profiler">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/110259/python-memory-profiler</a></p>

<p>The answers given also includes a graphical browser.</p>

<p>First, the code you wrote is wrong. There's an apostrophe too much behind <code>img</code>.</p>

<p>Second, you didn't assign an ID to your <code>img</code> element, so you can't access it with <code>document.getElementById</code>.</p>

<p>Use something like</p>

<pre><code>var docHead = '&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"'+
    'http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;'+
    '&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test page&lt;/title&gt;'+
    '&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;'+
    '  .larger { width: 10px }'+
    '&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;';
var docFoot = '&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;';

OpenWindow=window.open("", "newwin", "height=100,width=1000");
OpenWindow.document.write(docHead);
OpenWindow.document.write('&lt;img id="img1" src="webfonts.jpg"&gt;');
OpenWindow.document.write(docFoot);
OpenWindow.document.close();
OpenWindow.document.getElementById('img1').className = "larger";

<p>The <code>EntityPurpose</code> convention for class names works just fine in a lot of places, especially if you have several entities (Persons, Cars, etc) and several layers (Model, View, Action, etc).</p>

<p>I'd name your class <code>PersonPresentation</code>.</p>

<p>Dear ladies and sirs.</p>

<p>I would like to enjoy the <code>ResourceDictionary</code> + <code>StaticResource</code> functionality, but without the need to load PresentationFramework - pure System.Xaml.</p>

<p>I managed, quite easily, to define the Resources property as a dictionary, but I need a way to reference the items there, i.e. I need something like <code>StaticResource</code>. I looked at it with Reflector and it seems to depend on a stuff in WindowsBase and PresentationFramework.</p>

<p>I was wondering if there is another way, without gliding into PresentationFramework. I also understand, that I can to copy-paste all the relevant code from PresentationFramework leaving only the bare minimum to support the needed functionality - this is my last resort.</p>

<p>Here is what I have until now:</p>

<pre><code>using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Windows.Markup;
using System.Xaml;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
  [ContentProperty("Items")]
  public class XamlDictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt; : Dictionary&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;
  {
    public ICollection&lt;KeyValuePair&lt;TKey, TValue&gt;&gt; Items
    {
      get { return this; }
    }
  }

  public class A
  {
    private XamlDictionary&lt;string, int&gt; m_resources;
    public XamlDictionary&lt;string, int&gt; Resources 
    {
      get
      {
        if (m_resources == null)
        {
          m_resources = new XamlDictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();
        }
        return m_resources;
      }
      set { m_resources = value; }
    }
    public int Value { get; set; }
  }

  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      var a = (A)XamlServices.Load("A.xaml");
    }
  }
}

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;
&lt;l:A xmlns:scg="clr-namespace:System.Collections.Generic;assembly=mscorlib"
     xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
     xmlns:sys="clr-namespace:System;assembly=mscorlib"
     xmlns:l="clr-namespace:ConsoleApplication1;assembly=ConsoleApplication1"
     Value="15"&gt;
  &lt;l:A.Resources&gt;
    &lt;sys:Int32 x:Key="ssss"&gt;10&lt;/sys:Int32&gt;
  &lt;/l:A.Resources&gt;
&lt;/l:A&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good, everything is fine. Now I wish to change the Xaml so that <code>A.Value</code> reference the <code>A.Resources["ssss"]</code> value and here is where I need the <code>StaticResource</code> alternative.</p>

<p>Say you have:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
object Foo { def apply() = new Foo }
trait Baz
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre><code>Foo() with Baz
</code></pre>

<p>would be analogous to:</p>

<pre><code>val foo = new Foo
foo with Baz
</code></pre>

<p>which would imply some kind of prototype-based inheritance, which Scala doesn't have. (As far as I know.)</p>

<p>(I'd guess the error in thinking is intuitively mistaking the = sign for a "substitution sign". I.e. since Foo() means Foo.apply() and which "equals" new Foo, you can substitue Foo() with new Foo. Which obviously you can't.)</p>

<p>What you are looking to do is create a 'framework'. </p>

<p>This question is an attempt to find a practical solution for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1159932/critique-my-mysql-database-design-for-unlimited-dynamic-fields">this question</a>. </p>

<p>I need a semi-schema less design for my SQL database. However, I can limit the flexibility to shoehorn it into the entire SQL paradigm. Moving to schema less databases might be an option in the future but right now, I' stuck with SQL.</p>

<p>I have a table in a SQL database (let's call it <code>Foo</code>). When an row is added to this, it needs to be able to store an arbitrary number of "meta" fields with this. An example would be the ability to attach arbitrary metadata like tags, collaborators etc. All the fields are optional but the problem is that they're of different types. Some might be numeric, some might be textual etc.</p>

<p>A simple design linking <code>Foo</code> to a table of <code>OptionalValues</code> with fields like <code>name</code>, <code>value_type</code>, <code>value_string</code>, <code>value_int</code>, <code>value_date</code> etc. seems direct although it descends into the whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-attribute-value_model" rel="nofollow">EAV</a> model which Alex mentions on that last answer and it looks quite wasteful. Also, I imagine queries out of this when it grows will be quite slow. I don't expect to search or sort by anything in this table though. All I need is that when I get a row out of <code>Foo</code>, these extra attributes should be obtainable as well.</p>

<p>Are there any best practices for implementing this kind of a setup in a SQL database or am I simply looking at the whole thing wrongly?</p>

<p>This is my Model class</p>

<pre><code>public class Model
{
    [DataType(DataType.DateTime, ErrorMessage = "My error message")]
    public DateTime Day { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to input incorrect value for example "notdate" i got the error
"The value 'notdate' is not valid for Day." instead of my specified ErrorMessage "My error message".</p>

<p>I use ASP.NET MVC 3.0 beta. This is a bug?</p>

<p>@el.pescado, the string after executed by eval should be javascript understandable.
i.e if you are assigning the above string to  the varible as follows</p>

<p>eval(' var foo1 = {"foo" : "bar"}');
foo1.foo will return bar</p>

<p>so, my assumption is, as there is no statement like that starts with "{" in javascript, it is throwing the error.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I need to develop a program in Java to solve some integrals. Integrals like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/8/4/1845918e723ad0b5874fa2fb77870925.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>I've looked for some functions to do this, in java.Math but I didn't find anything.</p>

<p>Has anyone an idea to get a solution for this? (maybe some extra libraries or something like that)</p>

<p>Thanks a lot!!</p>

<p>You could instead of passing a filename to your save function, pass a Stream, TextWriter or similar. Then when testing you can pass a memory-based implementation and verify the correct bytes are written without actually writing anything to disk.</p>

<p>To test problems and exceptions you could take a look at a mocking framework. This can help you to artifically generate a specific exception at the certain point in the save process and test that your code handles it appropriately.</p>

<p>HI</p>

<p>I want regex option that find website links like here :</p>

<pre><code>www.yahoo.com

<p>is there anyway to track them all with regex ?</p>

<p>One possibility:</p>

<p>I want to implement a class in c++ that has a callback. </p>

<p>So I think I need a method that has 2 arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>the target object. (let's say
*myObj)</li>
<li>the pointer to a member function of
the target object. (so i can do
*myObj->memberFunc(); )</li>
</ul>

<p>The conditions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>myObj can be from any class.</p></li>
<li><p>the member function that is gonna be the callback function is non-static. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>I've been reading about this but it seems like I need to know the class of myObj before hand. But I am not sure how to do it. How can I handle this? Is this possible in C++?</p>

<p>This is something I have in mind but is surely incorrect.</p>

<pre><code>class MyClassWithCallback{
public
    void *targetObj;
    void (*callback)(int number);
    void setCallback(void *myObj, void(*callbackPtr)(int number)){
        targetObj = myObj;
        callback = callbackPtr;
    };
    void callCallback(int a){
        (myObj)-&gt;ptr(a);
    };
};
class Target{
public
    int res;
    void doSomething(int a){//so something here. This is gonna be the callback function};        
};

int main(){
    Target myTarget;
    MyClassWithCallback myCaller;
    myCaller.setCallback((void *)&amp;myTarget, &amp;doSomething);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>I appreciate any help. </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>UPDATE
Most of you said Observing and Delegation, well that's i exactly what i am looking for, I am kind of a Objective-C/Cocoa minded guy.
My current implementation is using interfaces with virtual functions. Is just I thought it would be "smarter" to just pass the object and a member function pointer (like boost!) instead of defining an Interface. But It seems that everybody agrees that Interfaces are the easiest way right? Boost seems to be a good idea, (assuming is installed)</p>

<p>You can't (as of this answer) do this in JavaScript, it's forbidden from touching the file like this (for hopefully obvious security reasons).  You can find a flash based solution, <em>maybe</em>, but video editing is still a very intensive thing.  For thumbnails, you're best off doing this server-side.</p>

<p>Your comment dismisses this because it's "time and resource consuming"...trust me, you doing this server-side correctly and returning a few KB in thumbnails is <em>far</em> faster than flash opening and playing with a video to get thumbnails (then uploading those too).  Also consider it from a security standpoint, it's consistent and prevents your uploader from sending fake thumbnails that don't match the video at all.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of classes extending an abstract Base class.
Each subclass takes an array as in the constructor, (different length depending on class).
These classes could be written by other people.</p>

<p>What is the best way to figure out the length of the array the class needs?
I could:
(A) Require that each derived class have a static method, returning the length.
However, the base class cannot enforce this, since abstract static methods does not work in java.
(B) Each derived class have a constructor with no arguments, and I construct 
such classes just to be able to call the countParameters() method, that
I <i>can</i> enforce from the Base class. This feels "cludgy", since I am not interested in creating such object, but only need some info about it.</p>

<p>The reason is that I am creating a GUI, that gives the user the ability to create 
instances of Derived classes, but each Derived class takes different number of parameters.
That is, I need to know how to draw the GUI before I can create the classes.</p>

<p>EDIT:
I could just require that each Derived class have a private 
constructor, with no arguments, and using reflection I can call the countParameters() method.</p>

<p>EDIT2: Actually, what I am interested in, is what the names of the parameters are.
That is, if the class Derived have the constructor</p>

<pre><code>public Derived(double name1,double name2,...)
</code></pre>

<p>I need a way to generate the String[] array </p>

<pre><code>{name1,name2,...}
</code></pre>

<p>I guess this would be impossible to do without creating an instance of the class,
but for the user to be able to create such class, he/she needs the parameter names!
Moment 22.</p>

<p>Add a string column "Metafields" to your table "Foo" and store your metadata there as an XML or JSON string.</p>

<pre><code>// Declare index in Header.h

index=0;

- (IBAction)next {
    index++;
    // Set imageCount to as many images as are available
    int imageCount=2;
    if (index&lt;=imageCount) {
        NSString* imageName=[NSString stringWithFormat:@"img%i", index];
        [picture setImage: [UIImage imageNamed: imageName]];
    }
}

<p>Where do I declare index in my header file and how?</p>

<p>There are two primary things I've written regarding <code>IDisposable</code>, and I recommend you read at least the first one: <a href="http://nitoprograms.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-implement-idisposable-and.html" rel="nofollow">How to Implement IDisposable and Finalizers - 3 Easy Rules</a> (I also have <a href="http://nitoprograms.blogspot.com/search/label/IDisposable%2FFinalizers" rel="nofollow">other blog posts on the subject</a>) and <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/IDisposable.aspx" rel="nofollow">IDisposable - What Your Mother Never Told You about Resource Deallocation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>When SHOULD I use IDisposable? Only when I have unmanaged resources?</strong></p>

<p><code>IDisposable</code> should be used for one of three things: freeing an unmanaged resource, freeing managed resources, and RAII. I prefer to use different patterns for these different needs.</p>

<p>Note that the rest of my answers (and the links) are all discussing <code>IDisposable</code> in the context of freeing resources. They don't address RAII.</p>

<p><strong>What variations of the dispose pattern are there and why do they vary?</strong></p>

<p>The Microsoft pattern is the most well-known. It handles freeing unmanaged and managed resources and allowing for inheritance. I prefer a simpler pattern described on my blog (<a href="http://nitoprograms.blogspot.com/2009/08/how-to-implement-idisposable-and.html" rel="nofollow">3 easy rules</a>), which is the pattern that Microsoft has <em>actually</em> followed since .NET 2.0.</p>

<p><strong>What are common unmanaged resources I should be aware of?</strong></p>

<p>My preference is to have a single <code>IDisposable</code> class for each type of unmanaged resource (akin to Microsoft's <code>SafeFileHandle</code>). So, any time you add a type of unmanaged resource to your program/library, you only have to handle it once.</p>

<p>The question then becomes "which classes should I dispose?", which has a simple answer: "all classes that implement <code>IDisposable</code>."</p>

<p><strong>Is it ever wrong or misleading to implement IDisposable?</strong></p>

<p>No. An empty <code>IDisposable</code> implementation is always an option. You <em>should</em> consider adding <code>IDisposable</code> to interfaces or base classes if you think an implementation may use them. This is a design issue, which I discuss more in my <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/IDisposable.aspx" rel="nofollow">What Your Mother Never Told You</a> article.</p>

<p><strong>Should Dispose calls ever be chained together, or should we rely on using statements?</strong></p>

<p>It's common for <code>Dispose</code> to call <code>Dispose</code> on all member objects that it owns. See my <a href="http://nitoprograms.blogspot.com/2009/08/second-rule-of-implementing-idisposable.html" rel="nofollow">second rule</a> blog post for more details.</p>

<p>Hi,
i'm looking for asp.net mvc business form templates. Nothing special just simple grid(delete, edit, create, etc), create new user, edit info, show statistic and so on. 
Any suggestion?</p>

<p>Basically I need to choose one so that, I can get familiar with it quickly and then customize it to my needs.</p>

<p>I'm a .NET developer and know classic ASP too. But I think understanding PHP will not be a problem for me and also think that it won't be that difficult. </p>

<p>What will you like to recommend me?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:- <br/></strong>
Sorry that I'm adding this info late.
Right now I don't know what customization I will be doing. But I'm sure going forward I will have my own requirement and will need to customize. So I don't want to be in situation where I will have to say <em>"This engine which I'm using will not allow me XYZ change or it will be too difficult for me to make XYZ change in this blogging software, so lets migrate to something else."</em></p>

<p>I will prefer a short learning curve.</p>

<p>I see two problems here: <br/>

Your logs contain <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> for classes <code>org.apache.commons.collections.map.LinkedMap</code> and <code>edu.emory.mathcs.backport.java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap</code> wich is quite strange, because your code doesn't mention none of these classes, and Spring, as far as I know, also doesn't use them. To fix this exeptions, you need to add Apache <code>common-collections.jar</code> and <code>backport-util-concurrent.jar</code> libraries to your classpath. <br/>
<br/>
2. You use <code>BeanFactory</code> implementation instead of <code>ApplicationContext</code> implementation. According to Spring documentation BeanFactory implementations by default doesn't support AOP. Here is quote from there:<br/>
<i>A BeanFactory pretty much just instantiates and configures beans. An ApplicationContext also does that, and it provides the supporting infrastructure to enable lots of enterprise-specific features such as transactions and AOP.</i><br/><br/></p>

<p>One trick is to use interfaces instead, that way you don't need specifically to know the class in your 'MyClassWithCallback', if the object passed in implements the interface. </p>

<p>e.g. (pseudo code)</p>

<pre><code>struct myinterface
{
  void doSomething()=0;
};

class Target : public myinterface { ..implement doSomething... };
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>myinterface *targetObj; 
void setCallback(myinterface *myObj){
    targetObj = myObj;
};
</code></pre>

<p>doing the callback</p>

<pre><code>targetObj-&gt;doSomething();
</code></pre>

<p>setting it up:</p>

<pre><code>Target myTarget;
MyClassWithCallback myCaller;
myCaller.setCallback(myTarget);
</code></pre>

<p>My goal is to replace all instances of a trailing - to a trailing + within tag brackets. Lets assume the line to be replaced looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h&gt; aa- aa- &lt;/h&gt; &lt;h&gt; ba- ba- &lt;/h&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>and should afterwards look like </p>

<pre><code>&lt;h&gt; aa+ aa+ &lt;/h&gt; &lt;h&gt; ba+ ba+ &lt;/h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>First I tried this expression:</p>

<pre><code>s/&lt;h&gt;(.*?)-(.*?)&lt;\/h&gt;/&lt;h&gt;$1+$2&lt;\/h&gt;/g;
</code></pre>

<p>which yielded this output:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h&gt; aa+ aa- &lt;/h&gt; &lt;h&gt; ba+ ba- &lt;/h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The g option does lead to more than one substitution per line, but only for the first instance per tag bracket (and only if both round brackets contain the question mark). </p>

<p>To narrow down the problem, I then tried to to achieve substitution disregarding the tags. The expression </p>

<pre><code>s/(.*?)-(.*?)/$1+$2/g; 
</code></pre>

<p>leads indeed to the desired result</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h&gt; aa+ aa+ &lt;/h&gt; &lt;h&gt; ba+ ba+ &lt;/h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will substitute outside of the tag brackets as well, of course.</p>

<p>So what is the problem with my first expression, and how can I achieve my goal of complete substitution within tag brackets?</p>

<p>You can use <code>for /f</code> to iterate over the command output:</p>

<pre><code>for /f %%F in ('ShowFiles ...') do ...
</code></pre>

<p>This can take some options that control how tokenizing will be done. In your case, the file name apparently stops at a <code>#</code>, so the following should split at <code>#</code> and only take the first token:</p>

<pre><code>for /f "tokens=1 delims=#" %%F in ('ShowFiles ...') do (
    echo File name: %%F
    echo File name without path: %%~nxF
)
</code></pre>

<p>You can then use the file names as shown above for whatever you need. If you just need to output them, then a simple <code>echo %%F</code> or <code>echo %%~nxF</code> will suffice. More detail on those things can be found in <code>help for</code>.</p>

<p>Didn't read the question properly the first time. You need a field separator that can be either a dash or a comma. Once you have that you can use the dash as an output field separator (as it's the most common) and fake the comma using concatenation:</p>

<pre><code>awk -F',|-' 'OFS="-" {print $1 "," $4,$3,$2}' file
</code></pre>

<p>I need not:</p>

<ul>
<li>sorting</li>
<li>filtering</li>
<li>grouping</li>
<li>column headers</li>
<li>row headers</li>
</ul>

<p>I need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Just 7 buttons(each a weekday) over the data matrix data</li>
<li>Scrollable data matrix</li>
<li>editable</li>
<li>row AND columns resizeable</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to choose this:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Scrollviewer with a Grid with several Gridsplitter and a Itemscontrol.</li>
<li>Implement IEditableObject into my ViewModel + IsSelected property to get the selected Item</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you think that can work? or you have any advice/hint for this adventure?</p>

<pre><code>DataRow[] rows = table.Select("Weight='57'");
DataTable dt = new DataTable();

foreach (DataRow item in rows)
{
    // add values into the datatable
    dt.Rows.Add(item.ItemArray);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If it doesn't need to be awk, you could use Perl too:</p>

<pre><code>$ perl -nle 'print "$1,$4-$3-$2" while (/(\d{3}),(\d{2})-(\d{2})-(\d{4})\s*/g)' &lt; file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the code.</p>

<pre><code>public class testClient {
public static void main(String[] args) {
    testClient abc = new testClient();
    abc.go();
}
public void go() {
    try {
        Socket s = new Socket("127.0.0.1",  5000);
        InputStreamReader  sr = new InputStreamReader(s.getInputStream());
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(sr);
        String x = reader.readLine();
        System.out.println(x);
        reader.close();
    } catch(IOException ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}

public class testServer {
public static void main(String[] args) {
    testServer server = new testServer();
    server.go();
}
public void go() {
    try {
        ServerSocket s = new ServerSocket(5000);
        while(true) {
            Socket sock = s.accept();

            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream());
            String toReturn = "No cake for you.";
            writer.println(toReturn);
        }
    } catch(IOException ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>java.io.*</code> and <code>java.net.*</code> are imported in both classes.</p>

<p>Now, when I try to run these(using different terminals), nothing happens. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>Screen: <a href="http://i29.tinypic.com/250qlmt.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i29.tinypic.com/250qlmt.jpg</a></p>

<p>and you have to cast to "char *" like:</p>

<pre><code>char * x = (char *)malloc(100*sizeof(char));
</code></pre>

<p>Because:</p>

<pre><code>void *malloc(int);
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>index</code> is used only within the <code>-next</code> method, you can define a static variable.</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)next {
    static int index = 0;    // &lt;-- here
    index++;
    // Set imageCount to as many images as are available
    int imageCount=2;
    if (index&lt;=imageCount) {
        NSString* imageName=[NSString stringWithFormat:@"img%i", index];
        [picture setImage: [UIImage imageNamed: imageName]];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that all instances will share the same <code>index</code>.</p>

<p>But I believe it's better to make <code>index</code> as an ivar, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>@interface ... {
   ...
   int index;
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>it is automatically initialized to 0 when the instance is constructed, and methods other than <code>next</code> can use the <code>index</code>. Also, each instance will have its own <code>index</code>. </p>

<p>The best solution, use <code>boost::function</code> with <code>boost::bind</code>, or if your compiler supports tr1/c++0x use <code>std::tr1::function</code> and <code>std::tr1::bind</code>.</p>

<p>So it becomes as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>boost::function&lt;void()&gt; callback;
Target myTarget;
callback=boost::bind(&amp;Target::doSomething,&amp;myTarget);

callback(); // calls the function
</code></pre>

<p>And your set callback becomes:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClassWithCallback{
public:
  void setCallback(boost::function&lt;void()&gt; const &amp;cb)
  {
     callback_ = cb;
  }
  void call_it() { callback_(); }
private:
  boost::function&lt;void()&gt; callback_;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise you need to implement some abstract class</p>

<pre><code>struct callback { 
 virtual void call() = 0;
 virtual ~callback() {}
};

struct TargetCallback {
 virtual void call() { ((*self).*member)()); }
 void (Target::*member)();
 Target *self;
 TargetCallback(void (Target::*m)(),Target *p) : 
       member(m),
       self(p)
 {}
};
</code></pre>

<p>And then use:</p>

<pre><code>myCaller.setCallback(new TargetCallback(&amp;Target::doSomething,&amp;myTarget));
</code></pre>

<p>When your class get modified into:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClassWithCallback{
public:
  void setCallback(callback *cb)
  {
     callback_.reset(cb);
  }
  void call_it() { callback_-&gt;call(); }
private:
  std::auto_ptr&lt;callback&gt; callback_;
};
</code></pre>

<p>And of course if the function you want to call does not change you may just implement some interface, i.e. derive Target from some abstract class with this call.</p>

<p>Add right after border.ApplyTemplate:</p>

<pre><code>border.Measure(new Size(width, height));
border.Arrange(new Rect(0, 0, width, height));
border.UpdateLayout();
</code></pre>

<p>Your border didn't update itself before you are saving it.</p>

<p>I watch a twitter search stream of </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"ruby on rails" OR #rails</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/sof_ruby" rel="nofollow">http://twitter.com/sof_ruby</a> isn't Rails oriented but some questions (such as this one) do come up.</p>

<p>This is a job for an implementation of <code>IValueConverter</code>.  Having posted many such examples in the past I realised that a couple of more general implementations would work of most of the time, so I blogged them.</p>

<p>The <code>IValueConverter</code> you need is my <code>StringToObjectConverter</code> blogged <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/codingbloke/archive/2010/06/09/yet-another-blog-about-ivalueconverter.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  With the code for this converter in your project you can create an instance of it in a resource like this:-</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Grid x:Name="LayoutRoot"&gt;
    &lt;Grid.Resources&gt;
        &lt;local:StringToObjectConverter x:Key="CountToVisibility"&gt;
            &lt;ResourceDictionary&gt;
                &lt;Visibility x:Key="__Default__"&gt;Visible&lt;/Visibility&gt;
                &lt;Visibility x:Key="0"&gt;Collapsed&lt;/Visibility&gt;
            &lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;
        &lt;/local:StringToObjectConverter&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.Resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and then used when binding to visibility, in you case:-</p>

<pre><code> &lt;ToolTip Visibility="{Binding Contains.Length, Converter={StaticResource CountToVisibility}}"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>BTW, are you sure you want <code>Length</code> not <code>Count</code>?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I think standard <code>awk</code> only allows one field separator character so you'll have to pre-process the data. You can do this with <code>tr</code> but if you really want an <code>awk</code>-only solution, use:</p>

<pre><code>pax&gt; echo '123,01-08-2006
124,01-09-2007
125,01-10-2009
126,01-12-2010' | awk -F, '{print $1"-"$2}' | awk -F- '{print $1","$4"-"$3"-"$2}'
</code></pre>

<p>This outputs:</p>

<pre><code>123,2006-08-01
124,2007-09-01
125,2009-10-01
126,2010-12-01
</code></pre>

<p>as desired.</p>

<p>The first <code>awk</code> changes the <code>,</code> characters to <code>-</code> so that you have four fields separated with the same character (this is the bit I'd usually use <code>tr ',' '-'</code> for).</p>

<p>The second <code>awk</code> prints them out in the order you specified, correcting the field separators at the same time.</p>

<p>If you're using an <code>awk</code> implementation that allows multiple <code>FS</code> characters, you can use something like:</p>

<pre><code>gawk -F ',|-' '{print $1","$4"-"$3"-"$2}'
</code></pre>

<p>My autocomplete results for each item looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;Celebrity Sweepstakes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;0 episodes&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But I want only the title inside the H3 to be highlighted. See the 'highlight' function below. I'm not sure how to change that original RegExp to only replace inside the title.</p>

<pre><code>$(".show_autocomplete").autocomplete("/shows.js", {
        minChars: 2,
        max: 100,
  formatItem:function(item, index, total, query){
    return "&lt;h3&gt;" + item.title + "&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;" + item.episodes + " episodes&lt;/p&gt;"
  },
  formatMatch:function(item){
    return item.title;
  },
  formatResult:function(item){
    return item.title;
  },
  dataType:'json',
  parse:function(data) {
    return $.map(data, function(item) {
      return {
        data: item,
        value: item.title,
        result: item.title
      }
    });
  },
  highlight: function(value, term) {
    var title = value.split("&lt;/h3&gt;")[0].replace("&lt;h3&gt;", ""); //only replace inside this?
    return value.replace(new RegExp("(?![^&amp;;]+;)(?!&lt;[^&lt;&gt;]*)(" + term.replace(/([\^\$\(\)\[\]\{\}\*\.\+\?\|\\])/gi, "\\$1") + ")(?![^&lt;&gt;]*&gt;)(?![^&amp;;]+;)", "gi"), "&lt;strong&gt;$1&lt;/strong&gt;"); //original regexp
  }
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>I am using the eclipse builder and not ant.
Actually what i did was that i defined web.xml in another folder. So now I have two web.xml, one for welogic with a lot weblogic specific stuff like filters. And i have another for development which i placed in another folder, in the web project and added this folder to the deployment descriptor for tomcat in eclipse. So now when i deploy the application, the web.xml for tomcat which is in my specified folder owerwrites the web.xml present in web-INF folder(in the deployment directory). 
 Looks to me a nice workaround.</p>

<p>In your case You don't need to maintain index while adding in ArrayList. 
I think in your case you require it as you save students information in multipple ArrayList like name in nem arraylist, course in corz arraylist ...etc. And then you use it for corelation. I think this is not very good design.</p>

<p>Good design would have been to create Student object with details like name, course, address etc, And then add Student object to Arraylist.</p>

<pre><code>public class Student {
    private String name;
    private String course;
    private String gender;
    private String school;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getCourse() {
        return course;
    }
    public void setCourse(String course) {
        this.course = course;
    }
    public String getGender() {
        return gender;
    }
    public void setGender(String gender) {
        this.gender = gender;
    }
    public String getSchool() {
        return school;
    }
    public void setSchool(String school) {
        this.school = school;
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Then your code will change to:</p>

<pre><code>    do {
        Student student = new Student();
        System.out.println("Add Records");

        System.out.print("Name: ");
        student.setName(scanz.nextLine());

        System.out.print("Course: ");
        student.setCourse(scanz.nextLine());

        System.out.print("Gender: ");
        student.setGender(scanz.nextLine());

        System.out.print("School: ");
        student.setSchool(scanz.nextLine());

        // Add student to students ArrayList
        students.add(student);

        System.out.println("Another?\n1.Yes\n2.No");
        adds = scanz.nextLine();
        addagain = Integer.parseInt(adds);
    } while (addagain == 1);
</code></pre>

<p>In this question I'm not asking how to do it but HOW IS IT DONE.<br>
I'm trying (as an excersise) implement simple map and although I do not have problems with implementing links and they behavior (how to find next place to insert new link etc.) I'm stuck with the problem how to implement iterating over a map. When you think about it and look at std::map this map is able to return begin and end iterator. How? Especially end?<br>
If map is a tree how can you say which branch of this map is an end? I just do not understand it. An how to iterate over a map? Starting from the top of the tree and then what? Go and list everything on the left? But those nodes on the left have also links to the right. I really don't know. I will be really glad if someone could explain it to me or give me a link so I could read about it.<br>
Thank you. </p>

<p>In JSF, you could render the page either with facelet or with JSP (although not recommended)
As far as I see, you are trying to load JSP page, while adding a facelet tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ui:composition xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"
xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
xmlns:fiji="http://exadel.com/fiji"&gt;
...
&lt;/ui:composition&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>. If you would like to use the pages with facelet, you can download an example that is using facelet <a href="http://www.coreservlets.com/JSF-Tutorial/jsf2/code/jsf-blank.zip" rel="nofollow">here</a> . As you can see, the name of the pages are postfixed with .xhtml and not with .jsp.</p>

<p>If you would like to use JSP your page has to be:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html" prefix="h" %&gt;
    &lt;%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core" prefix="f" %&gt;
    &lt;%@ taglib uri="http://exadel.com/fiji" prefix="fiji" %&gt;

    &lt;html&gt;
     &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;enter your name page&lt;/title&gt;
     &lt;/head&gt;
     &lt;body&gt;
&lt;f:view&gt;
            &lt;fiji:columnChart id="columnChartOne" value="#{GraphBean.monthMap}" title="One-series Column Chart" barCaption="none"
                              barColors="#{GraphBean.colors}" captionX="Months" captionY="Amount" toolTipValue="{y} {name} are sold in {x}"
                              subtitle="Hardware sales per month" width="400" height="400"&gt;
                &lt;fiji:chartData type="name" value="#{GraphBean.names}" /&gt;
            &lt;/fiji:columnChart&gt;
       &lt;/f:view&gt; 
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, I would recommend to you to use facelet, if it's a new project.</p>

<p>See a tutorial <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-facelets/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>One way, for testing at least, is to place crt0.o as the first file on the compiler or linker command line.</p>

<p>For production, you'd put it in the linker command file.</p>

<p>i want to show a tooltip when i highlight over any text inside of "<strong>class=div</strong>".  I have the following HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class='test'&gt;Test&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='tooltip'&gt;Tooltip 1&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class='test'&gt;Test 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='tooltip'&gt;Tooltip 2&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class='test'&gt;Test 4&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class='tooltip'&gt;Tooltip 4&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the following javascript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
        $(document).ready(function () {

            $('div.test').each(function () {

                var tooltipHtml = //NEED to figure out how get the html of the Tooltip div below this current div
                $(this).qtip({
                    content: {
                        text: tooltipHtml
                    },
                    style: { width: 450 }
                });
            });
        });
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>How do i get the html from the "next" tooltip div?</p>

<pre><code>HttpServletResponse objHttpServletResponse = (HttpServletResponse)

                                          .getResponse();
objHttpServletResponse.sendRedirect("Restricted/Home.jsf");

<p>Here, you leave the JSF API and cast down to the servlet API where JSF will not handle anything you do. When you invoke this method, the server returns a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html" rel="nofollow">302 response</a> instead of the AJAX response the JavaScript API was expecting.</p>

<p>The correct mechanism to perform a programmatic redirect in JSF is to use the <a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/faces/context/ExternalContext.html" rel="nofollow">ExternalContext</a>:</p>

<pre><code>FacesContext.getCurrentInstance()
            .getExternalContext()
            .redirect("yourUrl");
</code></pre>

<p>If you use this mechanism with an AJAX call in JSF 2.0, the server will send a response like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;partial-response&gt;&lt;redirect url="yourUrl"&gt;&lt;/redirect&gt;&lt;/partial-response&gt;

<p>Hello all,</p>

<p>My web application (ASP.NET v3.5 / C#) dynamically creates other asp.net applications (creates aspx, aspx.cs, classes, web.config, project.csproj file etc.).</p>

<p>The thing is even after I configure the 'new' application folder as APPLICATION in the IIS, When I try to browse it, I get the following parser error: <code>Could not load type 'Template48.Template48'</code> (where Template48 is my application).</p>

<p>When I manually browse to the new application folder, and re-build it, all works perfect.</p>

<p>How can I re-compile this WHOLE application, but in it's folder ?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Gal.</p>

<p>Your output is apparently buffered. After writing your output, try flushing:</p>

<pre><code>        writer.println(toReturn);
        writer.flush();
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you may consider calling <code>sock.close()</code> in your server if you're done with the socket, otherwise the client will be left wondering what to do next.</p>

<p>If I understand what the OP (person asking the question) wants, they want to make better random numbers.</p>

<p>rand() and random(), quite frankly, don't make very good random numbers; they both do poorly when tested against diehard and dieharder (two packages for testing the quality of random numbers).</p>

<p>The Mersenne twister is a popular random number generator which is good for pretty much everything except crypto-strong random numbers; it passes all of the diehard(er) tests with flying colors.</p>

<p>If one needs crypto-strong random numbers (numbers that can not be guessed, even if someone knows which particular crypto-strong algorithm is being used), there are a number of stream ciphers out there.  The one I like to use is called RadioGatún[32], and here’s a compact C representation of it:</p>

<pre><code>/*Placed in the public domain by Sam Trenholme*/
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

#define p uint32_t
#define f(a) for(c=0;c&lt;a;c++)

k(p *a,p *b){p A[19],x,y,r,q[3],c,i;f(3){q[c]=b[c

[y]^(a[(y+1)%19]|(~a[(y+2)%19]));A[c]=(x&gt;&gt;r)|(x&lt;&lt;
(32-r));}f(19){a[c]=A[c]^A[(c+1)%19]^A[(c+4)%19];
}a[0]^=1;f(3){a[c+13]^=q[c];}}l(p *a,p *b,char *v

</code></pre>

<p>There are also a lot of other really good random number generators out there. </p>

<p>Regarding your second question:
I can use the builtin dependencies management system. Can I indicate a filesystem repository path instead of an http one ?</p>

<p>Yes, just file maven2, you can use the file:/// protocol to locate a "remote" repository on the file system.</p>

<p>Also, look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern" rel="nofollow">Observer Pattern</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_and_slots" rel="nofollow">signals and slots</a> . This extends to multiple subscribers.</p>

<p>1: Use jQuery <a href="http://api.jquery.com/next/" rel="nofollow">next()</a> to select it.</p>

<pre><code>var tooltipHtml = $(this).next('.tooltip').html();
</code></pre>

<p>I'm going to throw out an alternative here, not RegEx at all.  Take a look at the <a href="http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">HTML Agility Pack</a>, your case would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>var doc = new HtmlDocument();
doc.Load("file.htm");
foreach(HtmlNode link in doc.DocumentElement.SelectNodes("//a[contains(@href, 'yahoo')]"])
{
  var href = link["href"];
  //href is a url that contains the word `yahoo`, do something with it
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's not really <em>answering</em> the question as you've written is, just something to keep your options open, as <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags">RegEx can have many other problems when applied against HTML</a>.</p>

<p>For sorting purposes, a map behaves like a sorted key/value container (a.k.a. a dictionary); you can think of it as a sorted collection of key/value pairs, and this is exactly what you get when you query for an iterator. Observe:</p>

<pre><code>map&lt;string, int&gt; my_map;
my_map["Hello"] = 1;
my_map["world"] = 2;
for (map&lt;string, int&gt;::const_iterator i = my_map.begin(); i != my_map.end(); ++i)
    cout &lt;&lt; i-&gt;first &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; i-&gt;second &lt;&lt; endl;
</code></pre>

<p>Just like any other iterator type, the map iterator behaves like a pointer to a collection element, and for map, this is a std::pair, where <code>first</code> maps to the key and <code>second</code> maps to the value.</p>

<p><code>std::map</code> uses a binary search internally when you call its find() method or use operator[], but you shouldn't ever need to access the tree representation directly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It says that once I finished my crt0, I have to "link it as the first object".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means precisely what is says. When an application for your OS is being linked, the crt0 must be the very first object file on linker's command line: before any other object file.</p>

<p>Traditionally, UNIX linkers resolve a symbol by making a look up starting from first object/library looping over to the last object/library. Putting <code>crt0</code> as the first object file makes sure that system symbols (functions, variables) are picked from the crt0 file, not some other file.</p>

<p>Additionally, as pointed by R.., traditional linkers assume that application's entry point is at the beginning of the code segment. That also fits to the source code found on the linked page: first symbol in the code is <code>_start</code>, the usual name of the program's entry point.</p>

<p>E.g. running <code>gcc -v a.c -o a</code> on my Debian (notice the <code>-v</code>), one sees following linking command (I have added new lines for readability):</p>

<pre><code>/usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.4.4/collect2
--build-id
--eh-frame-hdr
-m elf_i386
--hash-style=both
-dynamic-linker /lib/ld-linux.so.2
-o a 
/usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.4.4/../../../../lib/crt1.o 
/usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.4.4/../../../../lib/crti.o 
/usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.4.4/crtbegin.o

-L/usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.4.4/../../../../lib
-L/lib/../lib

/usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.4.4/crtend.o 
/usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.4.4/../../../../lib/crtn.o
</code></pre>

<p>One can see that crt1 is first object on the command line. Looking at the linker script (<code>-m elf_i386</code> -> <code>find /usr -name '*elf_i386*'</code> -> on my system <code>/usr/lib/ldscripts/elf_i386.x</code>) one can verify that on Linux there is no <code>crt0</code>, but there are: <code>crt1</code>, <code>crti</code>, <code>crtbegin</code>, <code>crtend</code>, <code>crtn</code>. And the application object files (<code>/tmp/ccndJ4YV.o</code> in the sample above) are put between the <code>crtbegin</code> and <code>crtend</code>.</p>

<p>It's not quite clear what you're trying to achieve, but I wonder: Do the subclasses really have to take a single parameter with an array, as opposed to a list of parameters?</p>

<pre><code>Constructor&lt;?&gt; ctor = Test.class.getConstructors()[0];
int parameterCount = ctor.getParameterTypes().length;
ctor.newInstance(new Object[parameterCount]);
</code></pre>

<p>When using PrintWriter you need to call flush method. Changed your code to following and it works :).</p>

            PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(sock.getOutputStream());
            String toReturn = "No cake for you.";
            writer.println(toReturn);
            writer.flush();
        }
    } catch(IOException ex) {
        ex.printStackTrace();

<p>Hi, 
I was wondering if there is any difference in performance (or any other important factor)  between a file sent to the browser from our server by this method : </p>

<pre><code>For i = 1 To fileSize \ chunk
  If Not Response.IsClientConnected Then Exit For
  Response.BinaryWrite stream.Read(chunk)
  Response.Flush
Next
</code></pre>

<p>VS </p>

<p>the old plain file access method that the IIS comes with.</p>

<p>We are working on a file manager handler for security reasons and would like to know what is the performance hit.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>On the load of your page call for the method </p>

<pre><code>Page_ClientValidate();
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to call it for a specific validationgroup call it like:</p>

<pre><code>Page_ClientValidate('somevalidationgroupname');
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to retrieve the state of the page you can call</p>

<pre><code>Page_IsValid;
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Frankly it's better to just use CSS to indicate which fields are required to be filled in. My former project used the client side validation approach when someone didn't enter information the first time but went to other parts of the page and on a second time it was opened then it was made clear by client side validation.</p>

<p>Perhaps it's handy to talk with a usability expert on how to best accomplish things before making extra additions to your codebase ending up in decreased user experience.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>

<p>The same question with answers can be found <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsphone7series/thread/f326ef8d-59ba-41f8-b3eb-eacc4f2fc04a" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>Hi, </p>

<p>I have 2 web apps running on the same server. I tested the following on localhost so far, but I am really curious as to whether there was any fundamental issues with this implementation.</p>

<p>Let us call these apps <code>Shopping.com</code> and <code>Checkoutshopping.com</code>.</p>

<p>When a user on <code>shopping.com</code> clicks on a PayPal button, I will trigger a function; the function's pseudo code is like this:</p>

<pre><code>function moveToPayPal() {
    // use curl to POST some data to function in checkoutshopping.com called track
    // will use the results from that curl POST and then redirect to paypal.com
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the meantime the pseudocode for track in <code>checkoutshopping.com</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>function track() {
    // will use the data from moveToPayPal and do some processing
    // will now write to session variable.
    // return results
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the user is directed to <code>paypal.com</code> from <code>moveToPayPal</code>. He finishes up and is redirected by <code>paypal.com</code> to <code>checkoutshopping.com</code> and goes to another function called <code>confirm</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function confirm() {
    // will need to read the session variable written in track
    // do further processing...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now here comes the problem. In <code>confirm</code>, I <strong>cannot</strong> read the session variable written in the function <code>track</code> which is weird considering that both <code>confirm</code> and <code>track</code> are in the same web app.</p>

<p>Please note the following:</p>

<p>1) <strong>I am not</strong> trying to access session of <code>shopping.com</code> while doing processing in <code>checkoutshopping.com</code> (I got a lot of replies from people saying I am doing this. I don't think that I am doing this. If for some reason, you think I am mistaken, please state so clearly.)</p>

<p>2) Please do <strong>not</strong> ask me <strong>why</strong> I am splitting the processing between 2 app. This is a long story that will only waste more space.</p>

<p>3) I <strong>have</strong> already resolved my issue (ironically enough with regards to point 1) by deliberately sharing session variables between the 2 apps using database. So please do NOT offer a workaround like this.</p>

<p>4) The reason I am asking this question despite having it resolved with a workaround is because I AM really curious why the original way did NOT work. Secondly, of course, I think the workaround is not as elegant as the original way. I want to improve my knowledge in this area of web programming.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>If the nodes are always qualified with namespaces URIs the you should add this namespace information you your JAXB bindings.  Many JAXB annotations take a namespace parameter (I.e XmlRootElement, XmlAttribute, XmlElement, etc.).
Also there is a package level annotation called @XmlSchema you can use you to specify a default namespace and the default namespace qualification rules.</p>

<p>In C++, pointers to class methods are hardly used. The fact that you called in - it is delegates and their use is not recommended. Instead of them, you must use virtual functions and abstract classes.
However, C++ would not have been so fond of me, if it not supported completely different concepts of programming. If you still want delegates, you should look towards "boost functional" (part of C + +0 x), it allows pointers to methods of classes regardless of the class name. Besides, in C++ Builder has type __closure - implementation of a delegate at the level of the compiler.</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry for bad English...</p>

<p>If you look at Apache ODE, they have a h2.rake task for Buildr that builds a database for testing automatically. </p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/qmx/canivete" rel="nofollow">Canivete</a> is a gem which enables you to deprecate your methods in simple and elegant way. A little more about it <a href="http://www.diegocarrion.com/2010/05/27/ruby-annotations/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>It sounds like you need the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern" rel="nofollow">Factory Pattern</a>.</p>

<p>In general, it's a bad idea for a base class to know the set of it's descendant's. So you define another class whose job it is to know that. </p>

<p>If you have something like a Shape, with ThisShape and ThatShape as derived classes, then a ShapeCreator will handle the job of creating the specific set of shapes your program supports, giving each one the arguments it needs.</p>

<p>Both methods need to push binary data to the browser.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>would like to know what is the performance hit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like always in such cases: measure. Try to optimize settings on IIS and measure again until you get the most optimal solution.</p>

<p>In my application i need to create HBITMAP objects to which I render and from where I copy the result. </p>

<p>I use the function "CreateDIBSection" to create these bitmaps, however this function required a DC (Device Context) as first parameter. Currently I get this by calling GetDC(hWnd) on the main windows handle (hWnd). But I would like to be able to create HBITMAPS without the requirement of having an application window, without some kind of in memory DC, Is this possible?</p>

<p>A web application needs to be compiled before it works; this is different from a web site. </p>

<p>Just providing the sources isn't enough; in fact, ASP.NET doesn't need the sources (aspx.cs) to run the application, just the .aspx, web.config, and .dll files ("assemblies" in .NET lingo). It is even considered good practice to remove the sources from the production system to avoid accidentally leaking the sources and giving attackers information about the site's inner workings.</p>

<p>To make this work, you need to somehow invoke the command-line C# compiler to build the project on the fly; this will generate the needed .dll files.</p>

<p>A different, but much harder, route would be to use .NETs ability to emit IL at runtime; using this facility, you could produce assemblies directly without going through the compiler. This is pretty difficult though, and you need thorough understanding of the IL to pull this off.</p>

<p>Thanks a million! That did the trick....</p>

<p>Check out this simple working example.</p>

<p>You could try setting <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hw8kes41.aspx" rel="nofollow">FormBorderStyle</a> to one of the tool window options - <code>FixedToolWindow</code> or <code>SizaableToolWindow</code>. I think that tool windows don't show up in task manager's list of applications, but I'm not positive on that.</p>

<p>Thanks ! cool !</p>

<p>You have a few basic options:</p>

<p>1) Specify what class the callback is going to use, so that the object pointer and member function pointer types are known, and can be used in the caller. The class might have several member functions with the same signature, which you can choose between, but your options are quite limited.</p>

<p>One thing that you've done wrong in your code is that member function pointers and free function pointers in C++ are not the same, and are not compatible types. Your callback registration function takes a function pointer, but you're trying to pass it a member function pointer. Not allowed. Furthermore, the type of the "this" object is part of the type of a member function pointer, so there's no such thing in C++ as "a pointer to any member function which takes an integer and returns void". It has to be, "a pointer to any member function <em>of Target</em> which takes an integer and returns void". Hence the limited options.</p>

<p>2) Define a pure virtual function in an interface class. Any class which wants to receive the callback therefore can inherit from the interface class. Thanks to multiple inheritance, this doesn't interfere with the rest of your class hierarchy. This is almost exactly the same as defining an Interface in Java.</p>

<p>3) Use a non-member function for the callback. The for each class which wants to use it, you write a little stub free function which takes the object pointer and calls the right member function on it. So in your case you'd have:</p>

<pre><code>dosomething_stub(void *obj, int a) {
    ((Target *)obj)-&gt;doSomething(a);
}
</code></pre>

<p>4) Use templates:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename CB&gt; class MyClassWithCallback {
    CB *callback;
 public:
    void setCallback(CB &amp;cb) { callback = &amp;cb; }
    void callCallback(int a) {
        callback(a);
    }
};

class Target {
    void operator()(int a) { /* do something; */ }
};

int main() {
    Target t;
    MyClassWithCallback&lt;T&gt; caller;
    caller.setCallback(t);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whether you can use templates depends whether your ClassWithCallback is part of some big old framework - if so then it might not be possible (to be precise: might require some more tricks, such as a template class which inherits from a non-template class having a virtual member function), because you can't necessarily instantiate the entire framework once for each callback recipient.</p>

<p>I got only one thing to work, although it's more a hack than a solution: In your sbt launch shell script, change the "user.home" java system property...</p>

<p>Unless you are dealing with a fairly large file, there shouldn't be a noticeable difference. Since you are creating the chunks manually and the flushing the buffer, you are going to have more packet traffic to the client (the payload of the packet or the last packet will be only partially full). However, as I said, this probably won't be noticeable unless you have a large file and even then it's not likely to show up.</p>

<p>If you add a target called static library you will get the equivalent of an assembly, just put all the sources in the target and decide what headers should be published and what should be hidden to the user of your library.</p>

<p>This is a test case:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div style="margin: 0 auto; width: 950px; overflow: hidden;"&gt;
        &lt;div style="float: left; width: 660px"&gt;
            &lt;form&gt;&lt;fieldset&gt;
            &lt;pre style="overflow: auto"&gt;Test test test Test test test Test test test Test test test Test test test Test test test Test test test Test test test &lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;/fieldset&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div style="float: right; width: 260px"&gt;

<p>I want the code in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> to show a scroll bar instead of overflowing into the "Lorem Ipsum" sidebar. If it's in a <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> (as in the example) it overflows.</p>

<p>If you remove the <code>&lt;form&gt;&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> it won't overflow anymore, but it won't show the scrollbar either (the overflowed text is simply clipped).</p>

<p>Here is what I want:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the text in the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> is longer than the available width it shouldn't overflow into "Lorem Ipsum" and it should show a scroll bar, whether it is in a <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> or not.</li>

<p>Hello all. My question is a design issue and it has been driving crazy over the last couple of days. I am new to cocoa touch development. </p>

<p>I have an application that has a UINavigarion controller and a 3 views. I need to keep communicate with a WCF service and store the data on the app side. </p>

<p>How do I create my Model (MVC) in a way that makes the data available to all controllers?</p>

<p>What I started doing is a singleton that handles all the storage and web calls but I read thru the threads that it is a bad idea. I also considered putting the code in the appDelegate but people say that is a bad idea too. </p>

<p>Conceptually how would u design your model and communicate with the controllers?</p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated. </p>

<p>I have this code below which works fine but seems unnecessary as it loops through all div.test even if i never mouse over them.  I tried putting the .qTip() function inside the mouseover event to be more efficient but that doesn't seem to work.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to make the below code more efficient?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    $(document).ready(function () {

        $('div.test').each(function () {

            var tooltipHtml = $(this).next('.tooltip').html();
            $(this).qtip({
                content: {
                    text: tooltipHtml
                },
                style: { width: 450 }
            });
        });
    });
</code></pre>

<p>You have valid C code, but you're trying to compile with a C++ compiler. (In fact, if you renamed your source to <code>memory_leaks.c</code>, your development environment would probably automatically invoke a C compiler; with <code>memory_leaks.cpp</code> it invokes a C++ compiler.)</p>

<p>C and C++ are different languages. C++ looks like C with extra stuff, because it evolved from a language that was C with extra stuff. But it's now its own language. Don't mix them up.</p>

<p>In particular, if you add a cast before <code>malloc</code>, you might get C++ code that compiles, but you won't get good C++ code. Don't do it: if you're programming in C++, use <code>new</code>; if you're programming in C, use a C compiler.</p>

<p>Buildr has an <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BUILDR-316" rel="nofollow">open enhancement request</a> with a gwt generation task that works for 1.5.3. It should be simple enough to move it to 2.0 to do what you need. </p>

<p>It's mostly wrapper code around the ant task, using Antwrap, the Buildr java integration, and inserting it into the project lifecycle.</p>

<p>This is kind of a newebie question, I'm trying to add information to my markers,
how do I add a balloon with information to this code</p>

<pre><code>map.addOverlay(new GMarker(new GLatLng(-34.8779420,-58.5514125)));
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand I have a second question, when I add the balloon for what I read I'm adding a second point but this point is clickable?</p>

<p>It is obeying it, but in the context of it's default behavior.  It doesn't have a <code>width</code> currently, and the default behavior of a <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> is to <em>not</em> have a width (but rather to expand into available space...and <em>it's parent</em> is willing to expand to accommodate it) so it's acting correctly. </p>

<p>If you <em>want</em> it to fit, just give it the same width as the parent, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;pre style="overflow: auto; width: 660px;"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I think that should use Queue</p>

<p>Are there any algorithms that allow efficient creation (element filling) of sparse (e.g. CSR or coordinate) matrix in parallel?</p>

<pre><code>how about this code:

public absract Base {

   public abstract int size();

   public Base(Object[] objs) {
      if (objs.length != size()) {
         throw new IllegalArgumentException();
      }
    //rest of your code.
}
</code></pre>

<p>each child class needs to implement size method.</p>

<p>hope its help.</p>

<p>You can do it with Buildr. You could live for some time with it. </p>

<p>Of course, like most people on the thread, I would rather not recommend this approach. 
You can also use base_dir to change the base directory of the projects.</p>

<p>Considering this class</p>

<pre><code>public class XQueries
{
    public IQueryable Query1()
    {
        using (XEntities context = new XEntities())
        {
            return something;
        }
    }

    public IQueryable Query2()
    {
        using (XEntities context = new XEntities())
        {
            return somethingElse;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is a connection to the database created for every (XEntities context = new XEntities()) {...} ? If so what is the correct way to create a static UnitOfWork class so that only 1 connection to exist?</p>

<p>Update the <code>ft_min_word_len</code> variable in the <code>my.cnf</code> MySQL configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>[mysqld]
ft_min_word_len=N
</code></pre>

<p>Note that afterwards indexes must be rebuilt.</p>

<p>I'd go with method A. You can't get the compiler to enforce the existence of such a method, but you can certainly enforce it in your program - no method, no work!</p>

<p>Seriously, this whole scheme is a bit brittle and I can't think of a way to make it significantly better. An incorrect implementation of those subclasses will bomb out, that's life.</p>

<p>A possible remedy would be for you to provide a set of interfaces for those subclasses, such as </p>

<pre><code>SubClassTaking2Args
SubClassTaking3Args
...
</code></pre>

<p>and requiring your sub's to implement one of those as a marker interface. But that's just more bureaucracy with little more effect.</p>

<p>This is a great tutorial that talks exactly about that:

<p>I am running into some problems right now.</p>

<p>I am developing a card game (Top Trumps) which is played by two players. I wonder how to best setup the architecture.</p>

<p>Right now almost all of the game logic is calculated on client side.</p>

<p>The game state is saved in a database table. The database is updated every second. But since two players are playing there are some problems. It's really hard to not run into problems with this approach.</p>

<p>Maybe it would be better to handle all the Game Logic on the Server Side with a WCF Service and just use the client side as a presenter. The WCF would handle all game logic, save/load the state in database and the two clients can ask for the game state which is sent via XML.</p>

<p>What do you think about that approach? How about performance? Or does somebody maybe know a better approach?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance. </p>

<p>I'm creating a single post per page tumblr template with the body content as the link to the next page - you can see a quick <a href="http://testb12.tumblr.com" rel="nofollow">test working here</a>:</p>

<p>There are 4 entries but the 4th doesn't render, probably because there is no 'NextPage'. Any idea how I might get around that to render the last page? or if it is has to be blank how to render a bit of static text. </p>

<pre><code>{block:Text} 
 &lt;div class="content"&gt;  
  {block:Pagination}  
   {block:NextPage}  
    &lt;a href="{NextPage}"&gt;{Body}&lt;/a&gt;  
    {/block:NextPage}  
  {/block:Pagination}  
 &lt;/div&gt; 
{/block:Text}
</code></pre>

<p>Disclaimer: I have no database to test on, these are just suggestions to get you started.</p>

<p>These examples assume you have some kind of constraint to prevent duplicate rows.</p>

<p>If you just want the topics that occur once in the list (that is, belong to one category only), you could use having:</p>

<p><code>select topic, count(*) from all_cats group by topic having count(*) = 1</code></p>

<p>If you want all of the topics, but only want them returned once:</p>

<p><code>select distinct topic from all_cats</code></p>

<p>If you specifically want all of the topics from cat4 and cat3 where the topic does not exist in cat4:</p>

<pre><code>select topic from all_cats where cat_name = 'cat4'
union all
select topic from all_cats where cat_name = 'cat3' and topic not in
  (select topic from all_cats where cat_name = 'cat4')
</code></pre>

<p>If you want a list of topics that belong only to cat4 or only to cat3 (exclusive or) you can use a variant of the having statement I posted earlier:</p>

<p><code>select topic, count(*) from all_cats where cat_name in ('cat3', 'cat4') group by topic having count(*) = 1</code></p>

<p>Hi everyone , i try to create an UISearchBar for my app base on Beginning
iPhone 3 Development book (chapter 8) , and i have 2 problem :</p>

<p>1- My Plist file is simple i mean without any <code>&lt;KEY&gt;</code> , and when i add the plist file into project and change the sortednames name to my plist file i have nothing in table !!!
i remove the table sections and index but doesn't change anything !! here is the code :</p>

<p>2-if iam going to search the Persian or arabic number , the result is nothing !!!</p>

<p>i remove these codes :</p>

<pre><code>- (NSString *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView 
titleForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section
{
    if ([keys count] == 0)
        return nil;

    NSString *key = [keys objectAtIndex:section];
    if (key == UITableViewIndexSearch)
        return nil;

    return key;
}


- (NSArray *)sectionIndexTitlesForTableView:(UITableView *)tableView
{
    if (isSearching)
        return nil;

    return keys;
}


- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView 
sectionForSectionIndexTitle:(NSString *)title 
               atIndex:(NSInteger)index

    NSString *key = [keys objectAtIndex:index];
    if (key == UITableViewIndexSearch)
    {
        [tableView setContentOffset:CGPointZero animated:NO];
        return NSNotFound;
    }

<p>The existing answers cover the bases fairly well for possible ways to compile your php code into an executable. That said, you may not have to go to those lengths, based on your question. </p>

<p>If all you are looking for is a way to execute php scripts in Windows away from an Apache server, then all you need to do is install php to your Windows machine. Then you can run any php script from the command-line by simply typing <code>&gt; php script.php</code></p>

<p>You can download the Windows installation package for this from <a href="http://windows.php.net/download/" rel="nofollow">http://windows.php.net/download/</a></p>

<p>EDIT: This answer is for the GMaps V3 -- which you should use if you are starting a new project - but your question implies GMaps V2.</p>

<p>Have you looked here: <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/overlays.html#InfoWindows" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/overlays.html#InfoWindows</a>  </p>

<p>It seems to me that Firefox doesn't correctly handle an instruction in a CSS file. I might be wrong, the I'd like to correct me on this.</p>

<p>Here's the relevant portion of my CSS:</p>

<pre><code>@media print {
  div.entry a:link {
    text-decoration:none;
    color:#999;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I print my page, the links are printed in black, regardless of the value after the <code>color:</code> instruction <strong>if</strong> the color is given in hexadecimal representation as above.</p>

<p>Interestingly, if I change the line to something like <code>color:yellow;</code> then the links are printed in yellow. Also, Internet Explorer prints the links in grey (#999). So, I conclude this must be a bug with Firefox. If it is not, please let me know.</p>

<p>I am usinf FF 3.6</p>

<p>You need to call <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/reference.html#GMarker" rel="nofollow">GMarker</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/reference.html#GMarker.openInfoWindowHtml" rel="nofollow">openInfoWindowHtml</a> to open an <em>info window</em> anchored to the marker object.  You call this method from an event handler that you add to the <em>click</em> event on the <em>GMarker</em> object:</p>

<pre><code>GEvent.addListener(marker, "click", function() {
    marker.openInfoWindowHtml("&lt;h1&gt;test&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;test marker content&lt;/p&gt;");
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an <a href="http://www.cannonade.net/geo.php?test=geo22" rel="nofollow">example of adding multiple markers and opening info windows for each one</a> (<a href="http://www.cannonade.net/geo22.js" rel="nofollow">source</a>).</p>

<p><strong>You second question:</strong></p>

<p>You can arbitrarily add markers to your google map and then add event listeners for those markers.  So, yes, your second marker can be clickable.</p>

<p><strong>N.B.</strong> You are using the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/v2/" rel="nofollow">version two</a> API in your example. Recently <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/" rel="nofollow">version three</a> of the API was moved up to production status and is recommended for new sites. </p>

<p>Here is an example of creating an info window and opening it for a marker in version three of the API:</p>

<pre><code>var infowindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow({content: "blah"});

var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: point,
        map: map,
        });

google.maps.event.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {
        infowindow.open(map,marker);
    });

<p>You can improve it a bit like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function () {

            content: $(this).next('.tooltip'),

});
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/docs/reference/#content" rel="nofollow"><code>content</code> option</a> takes a jQuery object (referred to as a jQuery DOM array in the documentation), so there's no need to crawl the HTML for each one.  <em>But</em>, if you're still binding a large number of these (hundreds or more) performance still may not be what you're after in older browsers.</p>

$select = Form::select('select_name',$options,$val);

<p>If you want to add a 0 value option, do:</p>

<pre><code>$options = Arr::merge(array(0 =&gt; 'Select some option'), $options);

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>as topic says, how do I get a td in a table by it's title? I then want to hide it.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>You can get one with CreateDC for the display:</p>

<pre><code> HDC hDc = CreateDC(L"DISPLAY", NULL, NULL, NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>Cleanup with DeleteDC().  It is only used to initialize the palette for bitmaps with indexed format.  NULL might work if you don't use such a format, never tried it.</p>

<p>Then there's GDI+, <code>#include &lt;gdiplus.h&gt;</code> and the Bitmap class...</p>

<p>Use object-relational mapping (ORM)...</p>

<p>Try the <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Doctrine ORM</a> project.</p>

<p>Another solution is <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/" rel="nofollow">CodeIgniter</a>, it has the best active records library out there. Very helpful.</p>

<p>If you still decide to write own class then use PHP5's <a href="http://snipplr.com/view/25491/php5-method-chaining-example/" rel="nofollow">method chaining</a>. Syntax would be prettier...</p>

<p>Looking on the web to find a good tutorial for implementing an auth system with Pear Auth(). I need to use different user permission, storing access level in a db field. On the official docs can't find anything about permission level...</p>

<p>How about</p>

<pre><code>{block:Text} 
 &lt;div class="content"&gt;  
  {block:Pagination}  
   {block:NextPage}  
    &lt;a href="{NextPage}"&gt;
   {/block:NextPage}  
  {/block:Pagination}  
     {Body}
  {block:Pagination}  
   {block:NextPage}  
    &lt;/a&gt;  
   {/block:NextPage}  
  {/block:Pagination}  
 &lt;/div&gt; 
{/block:Text}
</code></pre>

<p>This way the <code>{Body}</code> should always render, and the link only if there is a next page!</p>

<p>You should implement some of the state in both the client and the server - for example, a player can't lay down a card and then immediately lay down another card before the opponent has had a chance to play their card.  You're right, though - much of the logic should be handled server-side with clients intermittently checking for updates.</p>

<p>Hey all.</p>

<p>I've tried to Google and research this, but without luck.</p>

<p>I am curious to know how "modern" web-apps/sites do postbacks, meaning when they are sending back user-input to the site be processed.</p>

<p>Do modern sites still use the old fashion <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>-tags or do they use some sort of javascript/ajax implementation? or is there even a third option?</p>

<p>esp stands for "Something Stack Pointer".....ebp for "Something Base Pointer"....and eip for "Something Instruction Pointer"......
The stack Pointer points to the offset address of the stack segment.
The Base Pointer points to the offset address of the extra segment.
The Instruction Pointer points to the offset address of the code segment.
Now, about the segments...they are small 64KB divisions of the processors memory area.....This process is known as Memory Segmentation.
I hope this post was helpful.</p>

<p>Hello All!</p>

<p>My Delphi program has a built-in protection mechanism to check for banned license keys on the Internet and displays a message to the user if a blacklisted key is found.</p>

<p>I'd like to store the blacklisted key in the registry, so if the user tries to re-enter it (and he/she is not connected to the Internet), it's not accepted.</p>

<p>What is the best way to hide an obfuscated entry in the Windows registry?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: You guys have some good answers there, but I feel like I need to expand the question.</p>

<p>This is not mainstream software but a corporate one. Clients pre-pay one year and get a one-year license key for activation. The license key includes a machine ID and can't be used elsewhere.</p>

<p>The problem is that some clients tend not to pay in time or they don't pay at all. Since I don't want to bother with shorter than one year license keys (too much administrative overhead) I need a way to disable their licenses till they pay.</p>

<p>So the app now will connect to the Internet upon launch and check if their key is blacklisted. If it is, I need to disable access. In case they reinstall or block Internet access, I need to know if the key has been blacklisted.</p>

<p>Thus, I'm thinking it would be best to hide it in the registry. My users are not tech-savy enough to use registry tools to monitor the registry, but if I put it under HKLM/Software/MyCompany/MyProgram, some of them might do find it. So I need a place where they can't find it afterwards that it had been created. (Noone will be expecting it!)</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>In case you have a <code>&lt;form action="#" ...&gt;</code> somewhere, that's your culprit. Change it to <code>&lt;form action="" ...&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In answer to your first question try something like this.</p>

<p>var map = new GMap2(document.getElementById("map"));<br>
 var gmarkers = [];  </p>

<p>map.addOverlay(createMarker(new GLatLng(-34.8779420,-58.5514125), "Marker1")); </p>

<p>function createMarker(point, name)<br>
 {<br>
      var marker = new GMarker(point);</p>

<pre><code>if(name!="UserMarker")
    gmarkers.push(marker);  
</code></pre>

<p>GEvent.addListener(marker, 'click', function() {<br>
        <code>var HTML_CODE=  "&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;";</code><br>
         marker.openInfoWindowHtml(HTML_CODE);<br>
    });  </p>

<pre><code>return marker;  
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>I don't understand what you want from your second question.</p>

<p>Buildr uses the notion of scopes, coupled with the name of the projects.</p>

<p>Rake.application.current_scope should be the entry point to discover how to work with them. I hope this helps.</p>

<p>take a look at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t97s7bs3.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Trim()</code></a> which returns a new string with whitespace removed from the beginning and end of the string it is called on.</p>

<p>If you really want to go that way, hash or encrypt the keys and then check the hashed or encrypted user key to those on the registry.</p>

<p>Be sure to check if there's any keys in the registry to be sure if the user didn't erased them.</p>

<p>use the <code>String.Trim()</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>string foo = "   hello ";
string bar = foo.Trim();

Console.WriteLine(bar); // writes "hello"
</code></pre>

<pre><code>string a = "   Hello   ";
string trimmed = a.Trim();
</code></pre>

<p><code>trimmed</code> is now <code>"Hello"</code></p>

<pre><code>var dv = CollectionViewSource.GetDefaultView(yourObservableCollection);
dv.MoveCurrentTo( /* here your desired selection */ );
</code></pre>

<p>... see <a href="http://marlongrech.wordpress.com/2008/11/22/icollectionview-explained/" rel="nofollow">here</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>For 2):</strong> this is the default behaviour of ListView (and other ListControls). If the list-control does not have anymore the focus, the selected items are showed in gray. This is done so to visualize which control has the focus (and which control has not). </p>

<p>If you want to change the selection-behaviour anyhow, put the following markup into the ListView</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListView.Resources&gt;
    &lt;Style TargetType="ListViewItem"&gt;
        &lt;Style.Resources&gt;
            &lt;SolidColorBrush x:Key="{x:Static SystemColors.HighlightBrushKey}" Color="Red"/&gt;
            &lt;SolidColorBrush x:Key="{x:Static SystemColors.ControlBrushKey}" Color="Green"/&gt;
        &lt;/Style.Resources&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;
&lt;/ListView.Resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Change the colors as you wish. But as I mentioned, the default behaviour is for showing the user which control has been selected and if you change this behaviour, some users may dislike...</p>

<p><code>String.Trim()</code> removes all whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.
To remove whitespace inside a string, or normalize whitespace, use a Regular Expression.</p>

<p>The value of the utme gif Request parameter is <strong>encoded</strong> by ga.js--it's the only one that is, as far as i know.</p>

<p>Calling *__trackEvent* is the usual way to set the value of utme. These are client-side events though, which is no doubt why you are trying to set utme directly. </p>

<p>So if you just want to bind <em>5(Init*load_success*http://www.mydomain.de)8(userstatus)9(fan)11(2)</em> to the variable utme, and you can't rely on user-behavior to trigger that binding, then here's what i suggest:</p>

<p>Pack your data into a <strong>'custom variable' scoped to the page</strong>--this way, when the __trackPageview() is called, the value will be set.</p>

<p>Here's the analytics code required in your HTML to implement that:</p>

<p>The method signature for a custom variable:</p>

<pre><code>pageTracker._setCustomVar(slot,    // integer between 1 and 5, inclusive (just use '1')
                          name,    // user-defined name for the custom variable
                          value,   // string representing the value for the custom variable
                          scope,   // you want '3' for page-level (an int, not a string though)  
);
</code></pre>

<p>Within the HTML (order matter, of course):</p>

<pre><code>pageTracker.__setCustomvar(1, "A Name", "A Value", 3);
pageTracker.__trackPageview();
</code></pre>

<p>A key point here is that the parameter 'value' can be set dynamically, so for the 'value' parameter, i guess you want to pass in <em>5(Init*load_success*http://www.mydomain.de)8(userstatus)9(fan)11(2)</em></p>

<p>Finally, here are the two key sources (<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/gaTrackingCustomVariables.html" rel="nofollow">Implementation Guide</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/gaTrackingCustomVariables.html#usage" rel="nofollow">Usage Guide</a>) on Custom Variables from the GA Team</p>

<p>Use <code>String.Trim</code> method.</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)next {
    picture.tag++;
    [picture setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:
             [NSString stringWithFormat:@"img%02d.jpg",1+(picture.tag%2)]
    ]];
}
</code></pre>

<p>should be the simplest solution.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> on first click, goes to <code>img02.jpg</code>, on second click back to <code>img01.jpg</code> again. Increase the <code>2</code> to allow for <code>img03.jpg</code> etc.</p>

<pre><code>$("td[title='mytitle']").... 
</code></pre>

<p>look at this link :</p>

<p>If all you want is a tooltip why not do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="test" title="Tooltip 1"&gt;Test 1&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="test" title="Tooltip 2"&gt;Test 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="test" title="Tooltip 4"&gt;Test 4&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
$('.test[title]').qtip({ style: { name: 'cream', tip: true } })
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>qTip automatically uses the title attribute if no content is set.</p>

<p>whats the best way to investigate why a server is returning a 403 for a http web request?</p>

<p>Can an iis server be configured to provide a more detailed <strong>internal</strong> log for 403's? </p>

<p>My previous post got the tags partially stripped, so here it is again:</p>

<p>My goal is to replace all instances of a trailing - to a trailing + within tag brackets. Lets assume the line to be replaced looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h&gt; aa- aa- &lt;/h&gt; &lt;h&gt; ba- ba- &lt;/h&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>and should afterwards look like </p>

<pre><code>&lt;h&gt; aa+ aa+ &lt;/h&gt; &lt;h&gt; ba+ ba+ &lt;/h&gt;.
</code></pre>

<p>First I tried this expression:</p>

<pre><code>s/&lt;h&gt;(.*?)-(.*?)&lt;\/h&gt;/&lt;h&gt;$1+$2&lt;\/h&gt;/g;
</code></pre>

<p>which yielded this output:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h&gt; aa+ aa- &lt;/h&gt; &lt;h&gt; ba+ ba- &lt;/h&gt;.
</code></pre>

<p>The g option does lead to more than one substitution per line, but only for the first instance per tag bracket (and only if both round brackets contain the question mark). </p>

<p>To narrow down the problem, I then tried to to achieve substitution disregarding the tags. The expression </p>

<pre><code>s/(.*?)-(.*?)/$1+$2/g;
</code></pre>

<p>leads indeed to the desired result</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h&gt; aa+ aa+ &lt;/h&gt; &lt;h&gt; ba+ ba+ &lt;/h&gt;.
</code></pre>

<p>This will substitute outside of the tag brackets as well, of course.</p>

<p>So what is the problem with my first expression, and how can I achieve my goal of complete substitution within tag brackets?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to retrieve a collection of DTOs from my WCF data service in a way that will allow me to be informed every time a whole DTO from the collection has finished downloading, also I want to be able to read it of course.</p>

<p>Means, if I want to get a collection of users, every time a user from the collection is downloaded completely to the client (serializably-speaking), I want the client-side to be notified and be able to read it.</p>

<p>Is it at all possible?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Edit:
Is passing a callback from the client to the server, which the server will use to send the client each user through iteration, a possible/correct direction? Or is there a better solution?</p>

<p>I don't know FeinCMS, but looking at the GitHub repo it seems that the <code>feincms</code> application only contains abstract models. If you want to dump the data, you'll need to find where the actual concrete models are, and dump that app.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have this code:</p>

<pre><code>  - (IBAction)next {
     static int index = 0;  // &lt;-- here
    index++;
    // Set imageCount to as many images as are available
    int imageCount=16;
    if (index&lt;=imageCount) {
        NSString* imageName=[NSString stringWithFormat:@"img%i", index];
        [picture setImage: [UIImage imageNamed: imageName]];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and it is supposed to change the image on the imageview picture but it just changes the imageview to a white background and all my images are named img1 img2 img3 etc how do I make this work?</p>

<p>Please help.</p>

<p>Will</p>

<p>Something like ...</p>

<pre><code>$('table[title="the title"]').hide();
</code></pre>

<p>or if using the caption ...</p>

<pre><code>$('table[caption="the caption"]').hide();
</code></pre>

<p>Bearing in mind the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you wish to use any of the
  meta-characters
  (#;&amp;,.+*~':"!^$=>|/ ) as a literal
  part of a name, you must escape the
  character with two backslashes: \\.
  For example, if you have an an input
  with name="names[]", you can use the
  selector $("input[name=names\\[\\]]").</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As per <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/" rel="nofollow">Selectors - JQuery API</a></p>

<p>Here's one way to do it: split the string into tagged bits and non-tagged bits, and perform the replacement only on the tagged bits.</p>

<pre><code>$_ = join("", map { if(/^&lt;h&gt;/) { # if it's a tagged bit...
                        s/-($|\s|&lt;)/+$1/g; # replace all trailing '-'s
                    }
                    $_}
                  split m!(&lt;h&gt;.*?&lt;/h&gt;)!) # split into tagged and non-tagged bits
</code></pre>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I have a UILabel and when the value change in the label, I want to highlight it's background color from another color and exists for 2,3 seconds and get back to normal color. </p>

<p>Anyone have an idea how to do this?</p>

<p>I don't know the right answer, but would start playing from here: </p>

<pre><code>private void abuttonispressed(object sender, System.Windows.Input.KeyEventArgs e)
{
    if ((Keyboard.Modifiers == ModifierKeys.Control) &amp;&amp; (e.Key == Key.S)) 
    {
        //click event is raised here
        button1.Focus();
        button1.RaiseEvent(new RoutedEventArgs(Button.ClickEvent, button1));
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>I use around 1000 properties associated with a specific java.util.Properties which is backed by a file. The main reason for the file is to change them without recompiling the program and to allow users to adjust their according to their taste.
Some of the properties are used only in one place in the code, but there are some properties that are used several times in different segments of code and even different classes.</p>

<p>I have recently got the habit of declaring all those properties that are used as a String constants, usually in a seperate interface like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface AnimalConstants {
  public static final String WEIGHT_PROPERTY = "weight";
  public static final String RUNNING_SPEED_PROPERTY = "speedInKph";
  public static final String HOURS_OF_SLEEP_A_DAY_PROPERTY = "sleepHrs";
  ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>When a class need to access some of the animal properties, I just implement this interface and I have access to all those property constants declared. When I need a specific property I just use the corresponding constant, without thinking what is its exact name (since abbreviations are used often) and, what is more important, the risk of mistyping a property name is eliminated this way. Another advantage is that if I later choose to rename a property to make it more clear to the advanced user who configures those properties), I just need to change that name in the interface where that property constant is declared (and of course the property file), so no need to "search and replace" the entire project. Finally, I can easily check whether the property is being used or not; I just comment it, compile the code and see if there is an error.</p>

<p>However, in spite of all these advantages, I am curious what are the disadvantages of this approach. What interests me the most is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>What impact has this approach (1000 String constants) on the String pool? Or they are created on-demand when I access those constants? Does this prevent other Strings from being cached in the String pool?</li>
<li>What is the performance cost of this approach compared to the one where I use hard-coded String constants, is it the same (neglecting the cost of accessing field)? Does the String pool behave similarly or a lot different?</li>
<li>What's the average memory increase with this approach, are all those String constants kept in memory all the time?</li>
</ul>

<p>Any good comment/observation is welcome.</p>

<p>I don't think that the registry is a good place to hide such info, because anyone can download and use the Process Monitor (<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx</a>) tool and see what your program does with the registry.</p>

<p>And thinking about this again. You will probably make users of your software unhappy if it will leave things in registry and other "secret" places on the user's hard drive. Locations like that are also easily discovered by tools that monitor what system functions your software calls.</p>

<p>As an alternative you could embed the banned keys in your application when you release new versions. This way the banned keys will be hidden in the application making it much harder for crackers to bypass the protection.</p>

<p>The downside of this is that a user can potentially run older version with a banned key with internet access blocked to your site, but if your software is actively developed with new features and bugfixes added, then nobody would want to run older versions. And if you are very paranoid you could release "updates" which update just the embedded banned key list.</p>

<p>But in the end no software protection scheme is perfect. If your software is popular enough there will always be a pirate cracker who will figure out your protection and make a patch or even a key generator.</p>

<p>You can't. Don't believe those swf protector/encryptors. Both the content of a swf and a swc need to be readable by the AVM2 so it can't be compressed or encrypted or anything. Bottom line is that you can't really protect your as3 code from being reverse engineered.</p>

<p>All,</p>

<p>I'm a little confused over some of the concepts behind Windows Intentity Foundation and the overall architectural fit in a third-party "trusted" environment as regards Authorisation. I think I may have missed something but I can't see how it would work in the real world.</p>

<p>As an example, we have a number of systems behind a portal. Customers can access the portal and, based on their permissions they can access features of each different application. In the current scenario, we may have a single authentication step (user id/password) that passes the authorised identity/principal (against a custom authentication store) to each application. The application then uses this pre-authenticated identity to look up against its own roles to allow users access to certain features.</p>

<p>This is all managed internally - i.e. each application understands its own roles so each application has its own admin function that maps a user to a role.</p>

<p>Ok, so it works but is a pain to manage and our customer has to remember our portal user id and password.</p>

<p>I'd like to move to a trusted environment so that we trust the token from their STS and authentication is all hidden. However, I simply cannot see how Authorisation will work - we're asking that each third party implement roles in their STS to pass along with the token. We've shifted the admin to them which may break their security models anyway.</p>

<p>So we cannot delegate authorisation to them, and still need to manage the map of a trusted token to the roles the application requires.</p>

<p>So the great benefit of trusted STS, whereby user A leaves trusted company 123 and user B joins to take over, and they don't have to wait for us to make any changes..... just isn't practical in the real world.</p>

<p>Which is a shame, as I really like the idea.</p>

<p>Have I missed something fundamental?</p>

<p>It will vary depending on what exactly is being done, but most web-apps will do a combination of AJAX for short content (esp where live/interactive updates are helpful without requiring a page refresh) and "old-fashioned" forms for longer content wherein a full page load is not an issue. </p>

<p>Note that nothing about AJAX prevents its use for long content as well as short.</p>

<p>Also note that from the stand-point of the code driving the server app, there is not necessarily much difference at all between a request coming from a standard form or a request coming from an AJAX submission. You could easily structure a single script to properly respond to both types of request (though in some cases you can save bandwidth by sending a shorter "data-only" response to the AJAX version, since the client-side code can be responsible for parsing the data into meaningful content).</p>

<p>Anyway you have a # symbol either in form action or in link href.</p>

<p>Replace # with <code>javascript:;</code> in links.</p>

<p>Replace # with <code>index.php</code> or leave blank (<code>&lt;form action=""...</code>) in forms.</p>

<p>I tend to use <em>both</em>, where a full page refresh from a normal <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> submit works, but if JavaScript is enabled you hook up to the submit event and override it.  This gives you fancy AJAX if possible, and graceful degradation if it's not.</p>

<p>Here's a quick example (jQuery for brevity):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form type="POST" action="myPage.htm"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="UserName" /&gt;
  &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit me!&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the user has no JavaScript, no problem the form works.  If they <em>do</em> (and most will) I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
  $("form").submit(function() {
    $.ajax({ 
      url: this.action,
      type: this.type,
      data: $(this).serialize(),
      success: function(data) {
        //do something with the result
      }
    });
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>This allows the graceful degradation, which can be very important (depends on your attitude/customer base I suppose).  I try and not screw over users without JavaScript, or if a JavaScript error happens on my part, and you can see from above this can be done easily/generically enough to not be painful either.</p>

<p>If you're curious about content, on the server you can check for the <code>X-Requested-With</code> header from most libraries and if it's present, return just the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> or some success message (since it was an AJAX request), if it's not present then assume a full page load, and send the whole thing.</p>

<p>If we accept that the initial CTE takes an ID and lists all the 'ancestors' of that ID, I think that the following query tests for this relation. </p>

<pre><code>WITH cte As  
(   
    SELECT
        UserId,
        Forename,
        Surname  
    FROM  
        dbo.Users   
    WHERE  
        UserId = @Id   

    UNION ALL  

    SELECT  
        T.UserID,  
        T.Forename,   
        T.Surname  
    FROM  
        cte As C INNER JOIN dbo.Users As T   
        ON C.UserID = T.ManagerID and C.UserID &lt;&gt; @ancestorID
)   
SELECT CAST (COUNT(*) as BIT) FROM cte WHERE UserID = @ancestorID
</code></pre>

<p>It's a bit odd though, since given the initial function a person is in the 'ancestor' relation with themselves.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I removed the ManagerID from the select statements in the CTE since it isn't necessary</p>

<p>I have composed a simple mail message with ActionMailer</p>

<p>I've used "<a href="http://github.com/JasonKing/inline_attachment" rel="nofollow">inline_attachment</a>" gem, to make showing images in mail possible.</p>

<p>This message contains an image, that will be shown to a user. Text will be over it, so we get a nice composition.</p>

<p>The problem is - i cannot make the image no-resizable. As i shrink the window of Mail.app, the image will be down scaled too.</p>

<p>I tried to wrap this image into a holder div, but no success.</p>

<p>How it can be done ?</p>

<p>Try  </p>

<p><code>string myString = " Hello World ";</code><br>
           <code>myString = myString.TrimStart().TrimEnd();</code> </p>

<p>Note that the windows also show up in the Alt+Tab bar.  You need to change the window style flags by overriding the CreateParams property.  Here's a full example:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class Form1 : Form {
    public Form1() {
        InitializeComponent();
        this.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.None;
        this.ShowInTaskbar = false;
    }
    protected override CreateParams CreateParams {
        get {
            var cp = base.CreateParams;
            cp.ExStyle |= 0x80;  // Turn on WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW
            return cp;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>String.Trim()</code> will trim all spaces from start <em>and</em> end of a string:</p>

<pre><code>"   A String   " -&gt; "A String"
</code></pre>

<p><code>String.TrimStart()</code> will trim all spaces from the start of a string:</p>

<pre><code>"   A String   " -&gt; "A String   "
</code></pre>

<p><code>String.TrimEnd()</code> will trim all spaces from the end of a string:</p>

<pre><code>"   A String   " -&gt; "   A String"
</code></pre>

<p>If performance is important and there's no risk of '&lt;' or '>' in user names, this could work:</p>

<pre><code>string RemoveTags(string s)
        {
            int startIndex = s.IndexOf('&lt;');
            int endIndex = s.IndexOf('&gt;');
            return startIndex &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; endIndex &gt;= 0 ? RemoveTags(s.Remove(startIndex, endIndex - startIndex + 1)) : s;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>There are three built-in functions in <code>clojure.zip</code> to create a custom zipper in clojure: <code>vector-zip</code>, <code>seq-zip</code>, and <code>xml-zip</code>.  How do you create a zipper that can handle any nested collections, such as</p>

<pre><code> {:values [1 2 3]
  :flags #{:foo :bar}}

<p>I am experimenting with Spring Roo in a new GWT application. The Spring Roo GWT support is some way off ready for real use just yet, so I want to build the GWT stuff by hand using as much of the GWT 2.1 MVP stuff as possible. The problem I have is that Spring Roo "notices" my MVP-related classes and generates a whole lot of extra (broken) stuff for my entities. </p>

<p>How can I get Spring Roo to ignore the GWT side of my project?</p>

<p>What if I want to do exactly the opposite? I have the following structure:</p>

<pre><code>HTML
  html.js
    event_handler()
  SVG
    svg.js
      action()
</code></pre>

<p>When a certain event is handled by event_handler() I want to call action() but no matter what I try I get the error "action() is not a function"</p>

<p>I recently stumbled upon a cool feature in CVS where you can name revisions by date, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code># List changes made between the latest revision 24 hours ago and now

<p>Do any other repository systems (e.g. Git, SVN, Bazaar, Mercurial, etc.) have an option like this?</p>

<p>I want my view controller to display different views based on a condition that depends on some runtime checks (lets say a uiwebview at even hours and a form on odd hours).
What is the best pattern to achieve it in iphone project? Maybe I can hide controls based on aforementioned condition or maybe it is better to load different views?
or maybe i should load different view controllers and make the check in my parent view controller?</p>

<p>I feel like GMail is an excellent example of best practices in action, but I'm looking for a more theoretical code-based approach. CSS? JavaScript? jQuery? Let's hear it.</p>

<p>All I forget was the .jpg on the end of stringWithFormat:@"img%i" ;) Haha</p>

<p>You’ll probably have to split it into multiple requests in order to do this. For example, one request to retrieve the size of the collection, and then a separate request for each item in the collection. Then you know when each item completes. (If you do this, you can even parallelise the whole thing.)</p>

<p>You can't really subdivide a single call easily, so you'd best making one or two concurrent calls, and getting the objects individually.  Using some kind of manager class, and some multithreading, you could have an event fired when a call was completed - and map that to an 'object downloaded' event.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>I want to place a small circular login image on the border of <code>div</code> such that half image will be outside the border line just for style purpose?I think I have to set z-index but how OR is there any better way?  </p>

<p>Basically, there are three models.</p>

<p>The traditional form model uses form postbacks for every action that requires going to the server, and may use javascript to perform client-side tasks that make the user's life easier without compromising security (e.g. pre-postback validation). The advantage of this is that such a web application, if written correctly, will work without needing any javascript at all, and it is easier to make it work on a wide range of devices (e.g. audio browsers).</p>

<p>The server-centric ajax model uses ajax calls to provide partial page refreshes; the page is built like in the traditional model, but instead of triggering a full page post-back, client-side script uses ajax calls to send clicks and other events, and retrieves information to replace a part of the document (usually in JSON or XHTML form). Because you don't post the entire page every time, the response is usually quicker. This model is useful if you want to use ajax where possible, but still want to be able to fall back to traditional postbacks if javascript isn't available.</p>

<p>Client-centric ajax takes a different path; the core idea is that you write your entire application in javascript, using ajax to exchange data, not markup. When you click a button, the application sends a request to the server, and receives data. The data is then used for further processing on the client. This is more flexible and usually faster than the other methods, but it requires good knowledge of javascript. Applications written in this style generally don't work at all when javascript is disabled on the client.</p>

<p>I've used jQuery.post in several jQuery scripts now, and it all works fine. But after upgrading to WordPress 3.0, it stoped working.</p>

<p>I'm working on a plugin where I hve the following jQuery code:</p>

<pre><code>//Delete event and remove from UI
jQuery("#eventList .cancelEvent").live('click', function() {
  jQuery.post("/wp-content/plugins/wp-eventcal/myfile.php", { instance: 'cancelEvent' },
  function(data)
  {
    alert('test');  // Never fires because 404 File Not Found
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Firebug reports a '404 File not found' error. This is the link:
<a href="http://mysite.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-myplugin/myfile.php" rel="nofollow">http://mysite.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-myplugin/myfile.php</a></p>

<p>If I copy the link and paste it into my browser, the page opens just fine. No '404 File not found' error.</p>

<p>Looking at my Apache error log, I see the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Cannot map GET
/wp-content/plugins/I:/Development/wamp/www/norwegianfashion/wp-content/themes/norwegianfashion/images/icon.png HTTP/1.1 to file,
referer: http://norwegianfashion.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-eventcal/eventcal-manager.php
</code></pre>

<p>This is my Apache config:</p>

<pre><code>LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so


NameVirtualHost localhost

&lt;VirtualHost localhost&gt;
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot "I:/Development/wamp/www/"
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;VirtualHost localhost&gt;
    ServerName mysite.com
    DocumentRoot I:\Development\wamp\www\mysite
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

&lt;Directory /&gt;
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And this is my .htaccess file:</p>

<pre><code># BEGIN WordPress
&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

# END WordPress
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>  </p>

<p>Ok, I have narrowed it down to this.</p>

<p>I only get the problem when I turn on custom Permalink using /%category%/%postname%.<br>
If I use default permalink, all works fine.</p>

<p>So again, could it be my .htaccess file?</p>

<p>I would like to use the word wrapper for datagrid header, the problem is that it cuts the word to a new line, what i need is to add - sign after the word cutted...</p>

<p>what i mean is:</p>

<p>admins-<br>
trator </p>

<p>Is there any way to change left-margins for the nodes? Tree2 renders those margins with columns such as:</p>

<p><code>&lt;td height="100%" width="19" style=""&gt;&lt;img height="18" border="0" width="19" src="/vwwinner/faces/myFacesExtensionResource/org.apache.myfaces.renderkit.html.util.MyFacesResourceLoader/12806587/tree2.HtmlTreeRenderer/images/spacer.gif" alt="spacer"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</code></p>

<p>19 px width is too big for me, so I'd be glad to find out how to change this value.</p>

<p>Depends on what you have to do on window resize...</p>

<p>Usually most applications and websites use browser resize event for changing layout or increasing/decreasing font size when user changes browser window size.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2004/09/21/" rel="nofollow">Check this article out</a>...</p>

<p>It will be very challenging to achieve what you're trying to do, since a user can simply uninstall and re-install, and savvy users can wipe all traces of your app from the system (including the registry).</p>

<p>Other apps (like Windows, for example), instead of checking for a negative (banned key), instead check for a positive (good key). You "activate" the software once (when connected online) and this activation stores the "good key", which you can then check for whenever running the software (whether online or offline).</p>

<p>I'd suggest the second approach for you.  </p>

<p>It is not related to <code>@media print</code> or hex representation, but Firefox changing all gray color into black. You could try removing the @media or changing the color to <code>#ff0</code> or <code>gray</code> to see that these are irrelevant.</p>

<p>The whole gray channel is mapped to black, probably to ensure white-on-black text can be readable when printed without the background.</p>

<p>This problem has been reported in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=470854" rel="nofollow">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=470854</a> but it seems no one cares. See <a href="http://www.sanbeiji.com/archives/953" rel="nofollow">http://www.sanbeiji.com/archives/953</a> for detail (although it says "it is fixed in Firefox 3", it is not).</p>

<p>Mercurial has a wide range of date formats: <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hg.1.html#date-formats" rel="nofollow">http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/hg.1.html#date-formats</a>, though maybe not "1 day ago".</p>

<p><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=343142" rel="nofollow">This subversion bug report</a> indicates that Subversion can't do it natively, but does offer a tip on using <code>date</code> to do it:</p>

  <p>(2) Whilst Subversion doesn't understand -r "{3 days ago}", date can
  help out there too: -r "{<code>date -Is -d '3 days ago'</code>}".</p>

<p>Most web application use proper document layout and CSS to make the flow work itself out naturally when the user resizes the browser window, without executing any script at all. This is exactly what the CSS properties <code>display</code>, <code>position</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>clear</code>, etc. are for.</p>

<p>Subversion has a similar feature. For example:</p>

<pre><code>svn diff -r {2010-07-31}

<p>How can i get mouse coordinates in C under Mac?</p>

<p>I figured it out now all I did was forget to put .jpg on the end of the img%i ;)</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)next {
     static int index = 0;  // &lt;-- here
    index++;
    // Set imageCount to as many images as are available
    int imageCount=16;
    if (index&lt;=imageCount) {
        NSString* imageName=[NSString stringWithFormat:@"img%i", index];
        [picture setImage: [UIImage imageNamed: imageName]];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>you should clean all the targets before new images gets reflected.</p>

<pre><code>var fra = document.getElementById('frameId');
// following will work on same domain (or subdomain with document.domain set) only
var fraContent = fra.contentDocument || fra.contentWindow.document;
myLinkHref = fraContent.getElementById('myLinkId').href;
</code></pre>

<p>If this is cross-domain, then you will need to have access to add script to the child frame. If not, it can't be done without a server-side proxy.</p>

<p>Thats exactly what you need to do.</p>

<p>Give you img a class name. Then in your style sheet add something like this</p>

<pre><code>#classname  
{
position: absolute;
z-index: 10;
top: #distance from top of page#
left: #distance from left of page#
}
</code></pre>

<p>z-index needs to be a number greater than your div which will have an index of 0 if you haven't changed it.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>e.g. In a static library I had</p>

<pre><code>  void function (void);

  function();
</code></pre>

<p>And function() existed in the main application.</p>

<p>But If I build it as a DLL the linker complains that the function is undefined on the DLL.</p>

<p>Most decent web applications try to put <strong>progressive enhancement</strong>. Meaning that a simple old fashioned button click results in a form post which can be handled by the server. This is for the scenario of people who use an old browser or turned off javascript for some reason.</p>

<p>The enhancement can be done by using <a href="http://www.domscripting.com/blog/display/41" rel="nofollow"><strong>hijaxing</strong></a>. Meaning that that same page can perform, with the help of some ajax, the form post to the server but not the entire page. This enables users with javascript enabled to have a better user experience. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>old fashion -tags or do they use some sort of javascript/ajax implementation? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to have javascript to work on something you still need that somethingl old fashioned tags. Web applications can be structured down to 3 major parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content: HTML</li>
<li>Layout: CSS</li>
<li>Behavior: javascript/ajax</li>
</ul>

<p>1) g option works for whole regular expression incuding tags</p>

<p>2) use it twice or until no changes</p>

<p>The Entity Framework opens connections only when required, for example to execute a query or to call SaveChanges, and then closes the connection when the operation is complete.</p>

<p>From Martin Fowler’s book Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture in respect to Unit Of Work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you're pulling data in and out of
  a database, it's important to keep
  track of what you've changed;
  otherwise, that data won't be written
  back into the database. Similarly you
  have to insert new objects you create
  and remove any objects you delete.</p>
  
  <p>You can change the database with each
  change to your object model, but this
  can lead to lots of very small
  database calls, which ends up being
  very slow. Furthermore it requires you
  to have a transaction open for the
  whole interaction, which is
  impractical if you have a business
  transaction that spans multiple
  requests. The situation is even worse
  if you need to keep track of the
  objects you've read so you can avoid
  inconsistent reads.</p>
  
  <p>A Unit of Work keeps track of
  everything you do during a business
  transaction that can affect the
  database. When you're done, it figures
  out everything that needs to be done
  to alter the database as a result of
  your work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whenever I use Entity Framework for a clients (which I'd admit is rare) the ObjectContext object is the Unit Of Work implementation for the system. That is the ObjectContext will somewhat meet the three statements above. Rather than concentrating too much on the absolutely correct definition using the ObjectContext makes things a little easier for you.</p>

<p>Do some research on DI/IoC and Repository patterns this will give you more flexibility in handling your problem.</p>

<p>Hi, I have only recently started using Liferay 6.0. I have downloaded liferay-portal-tomcat-6.0.4_1 community edition.</p>

<p>First of all can you please recommend me some website and books or articles for Liferay 6.0? (The ones available on the Internet are for earlier versions...)</p>

<p>Secondly. I don' t seem to get the structure of Liferay. For example, how do organisation, communities, users, pages all fit in together?</p>

<p>I also had a problem getting nodejs to compile using cygwin - also a Python issue. I eventually found a reference to having to rebase the cygwin DLL links to make everything work. Of course I couldn't find my original source for help. But I remembered enough to find similar help.</p>

<p>So from <a href="http://avalanche123.tumblr.com/post/855374337/nodejs-mongodb-tinyurl" rel="nofollow">http://avalanche123.tumblr.com/post/855374337/nodejs-mongodb-tinyurl</a></p>

<p>I remembered that you can stop all cygwin processes, run ash (a minimal shell) that is typically found at C:\cygwin\bin\ash.exe and then, in this shell, run "/usr/bin/rebaseall"</p>

<p>Once I had run the rebaseall command I could, using the normal cygwin shell, successfully run the ./configure script for the nodejs source and proceed to "make" and "make install" nodejs.</p>

<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I have a page with a listview that shows something like posts. On each post there should be a "rate box" which works similar to the "Like" button in facebook. The rate box is a User Control, that has an update panel inside it.</p>

<p>If I put the control with some random values in the page it works great - but when I put it inside the ListView, where it should be located, it won't work. The method is being called, but nothing happens.</p>

<p>I simplified the code a bit to make it easier to understand:</p>

<p>The "rate box" control:</p>

<pre><code>    protected void OnRateClick(object sender, ImageClickEventArgs e)
    {
        Rate++;
        RateAmountLiteral.Text = Rate.ToString();
        RateButton.Visible = false;
        FeedbackLiteral.Visible = true;

        rateButtonPanel.Update();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>ascx:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="rate_div"&gt;
    &lt;asp:UpdatePanel ID="rateButtonPanel" runat="server" UpdateMode="Conditional"&gt;
        &lt;ContentTemplate&gt;
            &lt;fieldset&gt;
                Rate:
                &lt;asp:Literal ID="RateAmountLiteral" runat="server"&gt;&lt;/asp:Literal&gt;
                &lt;asp:ImageButton ID="RateButton" runat="server" ImageUrl="icn_rate.png"
                    OnClick="OnRateClick" /&gt;
                &lt;asp:Literal ID="FeedbackLiteral" runat="server" Visible="false"&gt;Thanks for rating!&lt;/asp:Literal&gt;
            &lt;/fieldset&gt;
        &lt;/ContentTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/asp:UpdatePanel&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>aspx (using the control):</p>

<pre><code>                     &lt;asp:ListView ID="PostsView" runat="server" ItemPlaceholderID="itemPlaceHolder2"

<p>While debugging I noticed the controls in the method "OnRateClick" are empty and don't contain the right values. Please advice. </p>

<p>Also if you have any comments about the way I did things, don't hold yourself.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Use a HTML-parser, e.g. <code>HTML::TreeBuilder</code> to extract the text within tags. Then you can easily modify it and save back to a string.</p>

<p>Most Android applications do not require authentication for local use. They may require authentication for access to online content (e.g., Web service), in which case the authentication is handled by the Web service and uses technology dictated by the Web service.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that any online authentication process (e.g., OAuth, Facebook Connect) means your application cannot be used in offline mode.</p>

<p>I am trying to figure out how we can run a html file within a php script.</p>

<p>HtmlHelpers are really useful, also i was using AjaxHelpers untill i wanted to do something they can't... so now i'm prefering jquery+javascript, but i don't like to write in javascript (mayby because i never know it as good as i wanted) and to make life easier i wanted to implement something like JQueryHelper, but right now i don't know how</p>

<p>I wanted to use inside of "Helper" resolved URL's, because most methods would just pass data to controllers etc... and update some parts of UI, so i'd like to create something like AjaxHelper, but based on JQuery, not MSScripts.</p>

<p>What should I include in such class? how can i get context, url's and generate proper javascript code which can by dynamicly injected into 
ex. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div onclick=JQuery.Action("&lt;ActionName&gt;", "&lt;Controller&gt;", new { param1, param2}, &lt;Id to Update&gt;)&gt; My Div&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How is it implemented in HtmlHelper or AjaxHelper?</p>

<p>Edit:
I've tried few simple implementation, but i think I'm lack of knowledge and don't know how to implement class with extensions exacly.</p>

<p>I've ClassA(class) and ClassAExt(extensions):
I've something like that:</p>

<pre><code>static public class ClassAExt{
   public static MvcHtmlString Method(this ClassA classA) {

   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>But in View(), when I'm using ClassAExt.Method() i have to pass also instance of ClassA (in helpers Ajax and Html this argument is grey (optional? not needed?), how to get such effect).</p>

<p>addstatefromchildren="true" doesn't work for me.
Can you tell me how you made it work more specifically?
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Node Comments are not shown with Core Drupal, you need modifications in your theme, or use a view (watch your performance!)</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> After discussion below, Drush seems the answer:
You can run any Drupal-code from the commandline using <a href="http://drush.ws/" rel="nofollow">drush</a>. </p>

<p>The CLR does not support initializing fields like this.  To make it work, the C# compiler <em>rewrites</em> your constructor.  The IL looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>  IL_0000:  ldarg.0
  IL_0001:  newobj     instance void ConsoleApplication1.Bar::.ctor()
  IL_0006:  stfld      class ConsoleApplication1.Bar ConsoleApplication1.Foo::bar
  IL_000b:  ldarg.0
  IL_000c:  call       instance void [mscorlib]System.Object::.ctor()
  IL_0011:  ret
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the Bar constructor is called <em>before</em> the Foo base constructor.  Which is the difference with your other snippet, there the Foo base constructor is called <em>afterward</em>.  This will rarely make a difference, <em>unless</em> the field is inherited and the base class constructor does something with it.</p>

<p>Or if field initializers depend on each other, they are initialized in strict textual order.  You can control the order by doing it explicitly in the constructor.</p>

<p>Yes, but this is hackish.</p>

<p>In the dll : </p>

<pre><code>typedef void(*funcPtr)(void);
// Declare a variable named "ptrFunction" which is a pointer to a function which takes void as parameter and returns void
funcPtr ptrFunction;
// setter for ptrFunction; will be called from the .exe
void DLL_EXPORT setFunction(funcPtr f){ptrFunction f;}
// You can now use function() through ptrFunction
foo(){
   ptrFunction();
}
</code></pre>

<p>and you call setFunction from the .exe. </p>

<pre><code>void function(){
    // implementation here
}    
int main(){
    setFunction(&amp;function);  // now the dll knows the adress of function()
    foo(); // calls foo() in dll, which calls function() in the .exe
    ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>Great, huh ? :/
You should probably refactor your code so that function() is in yet another DLL, but it depends.</p>

<p>Static fields are are initialized during the initialization phase during class loading.</p>

<p>But if a primitive type or a String is defined as a constant and the value is known at compile time, the compiler replaces the constant name everywhere in the code with its value. This is called a compile-time constant. If the value of the constant in the outside world changes (for example, if it is legislated that pi actually should be 3.975), you will need to recompile any classes that use this constant to get the current value.
This is when String Literals for unique string's will be created which are defined as values of constants.</p>

<p>But it is similar as loading constants from resources in Properties object (writing code for same). Constants definitely consume memory.
String pool behavior wont change.</p>

<p>Some thought on design approach:</p>

<p>It is very easy to put all configuration constants in a class, then refer to them throughout the app. 
To change the static configuration constants you modify the source and recompile. 
What if at some point in future, your program needs maintain more than one configuration, or to alternate between configurations as it processes different files, or even runs one thread with one configuration and another thread with a different configuration. You won’t be able to use that technique. 
So for better designs you store constants which never change as static constants in Class definition.These are loaded as soon as Class is loaded in memory.
In other case which i described earlier (Resource loading) you keep these in various properties files which can be loaded in JAVA Properties object. Examples for such cases can be  JDBC connection related information, etc...</p>

<p>This might best be solved by breaking it down a bit further. Aside from the fact that it is not being applied only to the <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>-content, is the current implementation otherwise working as desired?</p>

<p>If so, then instead of making the regex more complicated, you could separate the functionality out just a bit. Add code to identify and extract the title/<code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>-content, and then perform the highlighting on that with the code you have currently. Then take the results and combine them back with the rest of the original input and voila, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>-only highlighting.</p>

<p>A secondary benefit is that this approach is likely to make your intentions significantly more clear than a complicated regex, aiding in future maintenance, should other adjustments be needed.</p>

<p>Just check Apache's error log and you will see real request path and why it's denied. Most likely you failed with relative path to myfile.php or wordpress is blocking it.</p>

<p>You can also try to set full path to myfile.php in your JS code.</p>

<p>You sure the URL is correct? It is relative to the HTML page, and wordpress' index.php is normally at the same level as the wp-content directory. I'd be inclined to suspect therefore that the URL should be 'wp-content/plugins/wp-eventcal/myfile.php' ?</p>

<pre><code>include('my_html_file.html');
</code></pre>

<p>I would argue that, as with any permission failure, the server should give as little information as possible.  Giving more information could make it easier for nefarious folks to break into your system.  IIS does issue a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_403" rel="nofollow">substatus code</a> providing more information -- look in the IIS request logs if it's not in the error page to find it.  It is possible to map each of these error individually to a different, more specific error page, but I wouldn't.</p>

<p>Use transpose to get an array where each subarray represents a column and then map each column to the number of <code>true</code>s in it:</p>

<pre><code>arr.transpose.map {|subarr| subarr.count(true) }
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a version with inject that should run on 1.8.6 without any dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>arr.transpose.map {|subarr| subarr.inject(0) {|s,x| x ? s+1 : s} }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not avare of any fully only C implementation, but in the foundation framework of OSX (10.5+) there is a function called "HIGetMousePosition". You should be able to integrate this with your C program.</p>

<p><a href="http://allancraig.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=137:getting-mouse-coordinates&amp;catid=39:objective-c&amp;Itemid=86" rel="nofollow">http://allancraig.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=137:getting-mouse-coordinates&amp;catid=39:objective-c&amp;Itemid=86</a> shows this example implementation:</p>

<pre><code>int main (int argc, const char * argv[])
{

NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];

HIPoint point;
HICoordinateSpace space = 2;
HIGetMousePosition(space, NULL, &amp;point);

printf("%.2f %.2f", point.x, point.y);

[pool drain];
return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The best solution I can come up with is: don't worry if your order numbers are sparse. It should not matter if an order number is missing: there is no way to ensure that order numbers are contiguous that will not be subject to a race condition at some point.</p>

<p>Your biggest problem is likely to be convincing the pointy-haired ones that having 'missing' order numbers is not a problem.</p>

<p>For more details, see the Psuedo-Key Neat Freak entry in <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/bksqla/sql-antipatterns" rel="nofollow">SQL Antipatterns</a>. (note, this is a link to a book, which the full text of is not available for free).</p>

<p>In Flex 3 when adding a web-service, for each function a tailored event handler was made (e.g. for function GetCustomer there was a WebService.addGetCustomerEventListener) - How can something like this be implemented on Flex 4?</p>

<p>I think they don't actually copy the whole page for your visitors, all of what they need, is to track the <strong>mouse location (x and y coordinates) and a url of the current page being shown</strong>,</p>

<p>then they will make use of these information to show you all kind of information (where the user was looking, what have been clicked, ... etc).</p>

<p>The problem you're running into is that, using traditional ASP.NET Web Forms,  <code>&lt;%= %&gt;</code> code is evaluated very early in the page lifecycle, before your code has had a chance to run. </p>

<p>Instead, you want to use <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307860" rel="nofollow">ASP.NET Data Binding</a>, which uses a different syntax, like this: <code>&lt;%# %&gt;</code>.  (note the "#").  Then, to get this code to render, you've got to call the DataBind() of some server-side control when you're ready to replace the template with your actual data. </p>

<p>So in your server code you do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Preview = someString;
previewDiv.DataBind();
</code></pre>

<p>And in your markup, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div runat=server id="previewdiv"&gt;&lt;%#Preview%&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so I fixed the bug, but I'd still like someone who could possibly explain why this fixed made it work.</p>

<p>What I did was the following.</p>

<p>I wrapped the generated anchor links within a div with class 'tags'
Then, in a specific IE7 CSS stylesheet, I gave those links the following styles:</p>

<pre><code>.tags a { zoom: 1; }
</code></pre>

<p>Does <strong>anyone</strong> have any clue why that solved the problem? What exactly did that do?</p>

<p>Thanks!

<p>A simple solution is to override the <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/function/theme_username/6" rel="nofollow">theme_username</a> in your theme. That will not print the username, in /most/ places. Places that circumvent this theme_username and use their own logic to print a username (mails, titles etceteras) will still show the username. </p>

<p>Unless you are willing to build a module, this will be quite hard to achieve.</p>

<p>The eaysiest way to hide a key or a value is to create a key/value having '\0' inside of the name. You can do this wth respect of the native functions <code>NtCreateKey</code> (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff556468.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff556468.aspx</a>) <code>NtSetValueKey</code> (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff557688.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff557688.aspx</a>) which use <code>UNICODE_STRING</code> as parameters instead of <code>LPCTSTR</code>. You can read more about usage of native registry API in  <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/kb/system/NtRegistry.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/kb/system/NtRegistry.aspx</a> for example. A Delphi code you will find here <a href="http://www.delphi3000.com/articles/article_3539.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.delphi3000.com/articles/article_3539.asp</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED</strong>: Because many people read this question I want to add some words to my answer. I want divide the part of the question which we can read also in the title <strong>"best place to hide a key in the Windows Registry"</strong> from the subject with <strong>license keys</strong>. Because I read some answers (written before me) which concerned almost only the part of license keys and read practically no answer on the question from the title I wrote me answer.</p>

<p>The subject with license key I find very complex. It depends on the licensing model choosed. It's important how to generate, to distribute (to install) and to verify the key. Is key should be hardware depended or not? It can be one per computer or one per computer group. The key generation, key installation or key verification can be either with respect of some online services (also from the internet) or without there. I can continue... There are a lot of aspects, advantages and disadvantages of different approaches.</p>

<p>So I decide to answer <strong>only on the main question from the title</strong> which is clear and have a separate interest. All other questions about license key should be discussed in my opinion in the separate question after clearing all requirements.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED 2</strong> based on the updated question: It seems to me in your case would be better to use some scenario based on <em>cryptographic signing of an activation ticket</em>. For example the schema can looks like following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You software installed on the client computer will need an activation. Before activation it can not work or work in very restricted form (for example only some menus needed for software activation are enabled).</li>
<li>You write a server component which will be used by client during the activation to generate the license key based of the activation request received from the client.</li>
<li>If a client pay for the software you include the information about the client's "machine ID" (in any form which you want) in the database on the server.</li>
<li>After starting of the activation process from the client software (either at the program start of from menu or in any other way like you want) it collects some information about the computer like computer name ("machine ID"), some serial numbers or some other information about hardware or operation system which can not be changed without a new activation. This information the software send to your server (it is the activation request).</li>
<li>The server verify that the the client with the "machine ID" payed for the software and is not yet activated. Then the server calculate the hash (SHA1, MD5 or some other) from the information send from the client and sign the respond with the server's private key (or servers certificate). The signed ticket server will be send back to the client. This ticket will play the role of licence key.</li>
<li>The server can add any additional information to the ticket before signing. For example it can add the information about the date till one the software should be valid (for example, current day plus one year). So the ticket which will be send back to the client can contain the hash of input activation information and any additional information, all what you want. Important is only that the information should <em>be signed</em>. In general you can include full client's request as clear text in the servers ticket instead of including of the hash, but the usage of the hash a) reduce the ticket size and b) makes the ticket a little more secure.</li>
<li>Every client <em>have public key</em> corresponds to the private key used by server for signing of the activation ticket. The client save the ticket received from the server during activation in any place in registry of in the file system.</li>
<li>Every next time if the client software will be started the software will read the saved activation ticket from the registry (or from the file system). Then the software collect the same information, which are used for generation of the activation ticket, calculate the hash and compare it with the hash from the saved ticket. It verify of cause the signature of the ticket with respect of the public key (or with respect of the server's certificate). Moreover the software can verify any other additional policy information from the ticket like the time till one the ticket is valid.</li>
</ul>

<p>All written is a roughly schema only, but it is very simple and it is extensible. You need only study how use some simple cryptographic operation and implement there in your software. </p>

<p>As a option you can don't have a server online, but instead of that implement in the software (in menu for example) a possibility <em>to generate the activation request</em> and <em>send it per email</em> for example. Then you can offline (!!!) generate an activation ticket based of the server request and send the ticket back to the client also per email. A simple Reg-file which can be imported by double-click or some other simple import possibility in your software (cut &amp; paste in the activation dialog) can end the process of the software activation.</p>

<p><strong>Hi I want to Know that in C# applications, we have database of SQLSERVER also attached with it....and definately we need a connection string to connect the application with database....How can we make connection string Generic so that wherever it is deployed I dnt need to change the path everytime</strong></p>

<p>I have a <code>User</code> and <code>Group</code> model.  <code>User</code> <code>has_many</code> <code>Groups</code> and <code>Group</code> <code>belongs_to</code> <code>User</code></p>

<p>I already have entries in the user table:</p>

<pre><code>id    name
--------------
1     testuser
2     someotheruser
</code></pre>

<p>Imagine if the user with id <code>1 (testuser)</code> is logged in and I want to create groups inside that user.</p>

<p>When I create a new group from new action in Group Controller the entries in the DB are going like this:</p>

<pre><code>   id   groupname   user_id
   ------------------------
   1    groupA
   2    groupB
</code></pre>

<p>as you see, user_id, column is always going in as blank so the association is not there. </p>

<p>What do I need to do to make this association?</p>

<p>code for <code>GroupsController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>  def new
    @group = Group.new
  end

  def create
    @group = Group.new(params[:group])
    if @group.save
      flash[:notice] = "Successfully created group."
      redirect_to groups_url
    else
      render :action =&gt; 'new'
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>code for <code>views/groups/new.html.erb</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;% title "New Group" %&gt;

&lt;% form_for @group do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;%= f.error_messages %&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= f.label :name %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;%= f.text_field :name %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= f.label :description %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;%= f.text_field :description %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= f.submit %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;%= link_to "Back to List", groups_path %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I am new to rails please tell me how to make association with the user.   From the console I am able to make the association by adding groups for a user like this:</p>

<pre><code>@u = User.find(1)
@u.groups.create(:groupname=&gt;"groupA")
@u.save
</code></pre>

<p>but I dont know how to get this done from the front end. </p>

<p>If you store your matrix as a coordinate map, any language which has a concurrent dictionary implementation available should do the job for you.  </p>

<p>Java's got the <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>, and .NET 4 has <code>ConcurrentDictionary</code>, both of which allow multi-threaded non-blocking (afaik) element insertion in parallel. </p>

<p>Hi!
I want to use WebBrowser control to load some localfile html page. I am aware that WebBrowser is just a wrapper around the InternetExplorer. As I remember Microsoft allowed users in Vista (?) to "uninstall" the InternetExplorer...</p>

<p>The question is:
Does WebBrowser runs smoothly with InternetExplorer uninstalled ? Does this uninstall do not affect DLL responsible for webpage rendering ? </p>

<p>I would apprecieate any input on this matter :)!</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>I am using cakePHP 1.26<br/>
I got an Input Text box which contains a URL and I want to submit the URL and stored it in the Database using Jquery AJAX.<br/></p>

<p>Here is the HTML part:<br/></p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="text" id="testing" value="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is the JQuery part:<br/></p>

<pre><code>  var whatContent=$("#testing").val();
      var curl="http://localhost:8080/test/grab/"+whatContent;
      $.ajax({
      type: "POST",
      url: curl,   
      success: function(data) {    
      alert(data);}
      });
</code></pre>

<p>This is the code for the Action in the Controller:</p>

<pre><code>function grab($w=null){
   if($w!=null){
     return $w;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code worked and I could see the Alert Message pop up, but it showed:
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a><br/>
instead of <br/>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask</a><br/></p>

<p>I have tried using escape(whatContent), and encodeURI(whatContent), but they could not help,<br/>
the Alert box still showed me
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">http://stackoverflow.com/</a><br/>
instead of <br/>
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask</a><br/></p>

<p>I am not sure how to do with the URL data that contains some special characters in it.</p>

<pre><code>array = [[true, true, false],
         [false, true, true],
         [false, true, true]]
array.transpose.map {|x| x.count {|y| y}}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there are ordinary end-consumer tools that monitor what applications write to the registry (like Cleansweep). This goes on API call level, so it will probably catch #0 workarounds too.</p>

<p>You could try to encrypt the whole shebang in a registry key, with something that uniquely identifies the machine (like a mac address) and a timestamp, to avoid that people can move the key to other machines. THen always require the presence of such key to startup, and demand to connect to internet for updates/activation if it is not there. (or the timestamp is very old)</p>

<p>If you are looking to build your own access-module, <a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer--examples--node_access_example--node_access_example.module/6" rel="nofollow">this piece of API documentation</a> is probably the only place that has somewhat decent documentation on what to look at/for. </p>

<p>Your own custom work will come in on <code>http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer--examples--node_access_example--node_access_example.module/6</code> and the <code>_update</code> equivalent. On these hooks/callbacks, you must not only insert the current GRANT, but GRANTS for all the referenced nodes too. </p>

<p>hi,</p>

<p>i am getting error after post, when i am using dropdown in my mvc website, the code is as follows</p>

<p>The validation is not working, and also after i catch error i fill the viewdata["JobSite_JobCategories1"] with selectlist again but still, it gives error</p>

<p>Is there any librtmp c# .net wrapper?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I want to build the GWT stuff by hand using as much of the GWT 2.1 MVP stuff as possible"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're building GWT by hand, it sounds like you're interested in using Spring Roo to generate your data model code — but don't want (or need) any of Spring Roo's web controller code. If that's the case then you can separate your project into two modules:</p>

<ul>
<li>A module containing model and persistence code that is created by Spring Roo</li>
<li>A GWT web application that you create by hand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make the first (Roo) module a dependency of the second (GWT) module. Basically you're using Roo to create a JAR library that's used by your web application. As long as you don't run the <code>controller</code> command the Roo won't add any web application code to your module.</p>

<p>you could do something like <a href="http://jsbin.com/ezima/2/" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is you make a large wrapper (<code>#main</code>,the lightest one) and you place 2 divs inside:<code>#left</code> and <code>#right</code>. </p>

<p>left is a fixed width div <code>width:200px</code> and floats left <code>float:left</code>.</p>

<p>right is liquid so no width, but to prevent <code>#left</code> from overlapping you give <code>#right</code> a margin of the width of <code>#left</code> -> <code>margin:0 0 0 200px</code>.</p>

<p>To prevent <code>#right</code> from being to small you give it a minimum width <code>min-width:400px</code>. Now when you resize the window <code>#right</code> will resize along until <code>#right</code> gets at <code>400px</code> then the scrollbars will be visible</p>

<p>Here's another solution:</p>

<pre><code>b.transpose.collect{|x| x.reject{|y| y != true}.length}

        &lt;/f:view&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>this is my faces-config entry:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;managed-bean&gt;
  &lt;managed-bean-name&gt;ChartBean&lt;/managed-bean-name&gt;
  &lt;managed-bean-class&gt;com.pardis.healthMonitor.LiveChartBean&lt;/managed-bean-class&gt;
  &lt;managed-bean-scope&gt;request&lt;/managed-bean-scope&gt;
  &lt;managed-property&gt;
   &lt;property-name&gt;primaryKey&lt;/property-name&gt;
   &lt;property-class&gt;java.lang.Integer&lt;/property-class&gt;
   &lt;value&gt;#{param.primaryKey}&lt;/value&gt;
  &lt;/managed-property&gt;
 &lt;/managed-bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>i have passed primaryKey by url to jsf page it works fine and the setPrimaryKey method </p>

<p>called for the first time but after that </p>

<p>i have two problems:</p>

<p>1- it throws javax.el.ELException: Can't set property 'primaryKey' on class 'com.pardis.healthMonitor.LiveChartBean' to value 'null'.</p>

<p>and </p>

<ol>
<li>getChartData() method only called seven times!!!!</li>
</ol>

<p>You can do this very easily using divs. Consider the following code</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Logo test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div style="position: relative; width: 400px; height: 100px; margin: 0px auto 0px auto; top: 50px; background-color: #f00;"&gt;
 &lt;div style="position: relative; height: 100px; width: 100px; background-color: blue; left: 20px; top: -50px;"&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All you have to do is replace the second divs "background-color" property with the "background-image" property and nest that div inside your existing div. Make sure you make the div the exact size of your logo and set background-repeat: no-repeat;</p>

<p>Hope that helps. Test the example code I posted. You can place all the style information into a css class like this:</p>

<pre><code>.logo
{
   background-image: url(yourlogo.png);
   background-repeat: no-repeat;
   width:  /* width of logo */
   height: /* height of logo */
   top:    /* distance from top */
   left:   /* distance from left */
}
</code></pre>

<p>AFAIK the google analytics "hot links" widget doesn't copy the page at all -- it just shows it in an iFrame with stuff overlaid on it. (in google analytics' case, they can also modify the page display by sending instructions to the analytics JS embedded in the page.)</p>

<p>The above looks like a whole different kettle of fish though -- you sure it is html and not a screenshot?</p>

<p>Why do you want librtmp wrpaper? Can't you just use a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2319378/rtmp-c-client-library">.NET RTMP library</a>?</p>

<p>Yes it does.  'Uninstalling' IE has no effect on this component.</p>

<p>Don't you have to be logged into SO to ask a question? It would make sense that SO is just redirecting your request to the main page.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>for quite a while I have been trying to solve an issue with a Null Pointer Exception while populating a ViewStub. What I am trying to do is within a SlidingDrawer that contains some imageButtons and ViewStubs to fill in the ViewStubs when an ImageButton is pressed. I have been following the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewStub.html" rel="nofollow">ViewStub Class Overview</a> to create the ViewStubs, but I still get the Null Pointer Exception. If someone could help me out here, that would be great because I really don't know anymore what I should do to solve this issue...I will post my code below</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is the part of my code causing the exception:</p>

<pre><code>btnExposure = (ImageButton) findViewById(R.id.button_exposure);

        btnExposure.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener()
        {

         @Override
   public void onClick(View v) {
          try{   
           ViewStub stub = (ViewStub) findViewById(R.id.stub_exposure);
           importStub = stub.inflate();
          }catch (Exception e){
                 Log.e("ERROR", "Error in Code:" +e.toString());}
   }
        });

<p>You will get different advice because opinions differ on the best method to use. As you noted, for handling a data model, there are two major design patterns: Dependency Injection and Singleton. </p>

<p>Dependency Injection relies on passing the data model object from view controller to view controller as needed. Marcus Zarra (author of <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1934356328" rel="nofollow">Core Data: Apple's API for Persisting Data on Mac OS X</a> which I recommend) wrote <a href="http://www.mac-developer-network.com/articles/cd0004.html" rel="nofollow">a good article explaining Dependency Injection</a>. Most of the Apple documentation recommends that you use the Dependency Injection design. </p>

<p>I like the Singleton pattern but it is very, very, very dangerous for a novice to use. The Singleton pattern is so easy to do wrong that most graybeards have given up on it and simply advise novices to never use it. </p>

<p>The Singleton pattern has the advantage of increasing modularity and flexibility of the app. However, it requires that you have a firm idea of what the data model will do before you start coding both the Data Model and the UI. It requires more work up front to get correct and it is not as forgiving as Dependency Injection. You have to use singletons with greater discipline. </p>

<p>For a simple app with three hierarchal views, Dependency Injection is the simplest and cleanest design to implement. You won't need the flexibility of a singleton and a singleton will just add unneeded complexity. The Navigation-based template with Core Data provided by Xcode will give you 50% of the app to start. Just add the second and third tier views and you're done. </p>

<p>Hi. I'm using the <a href="http://www.tecnick.com/public/code/cp_dpage.php?aiocp_dp=tcpdf" rel="nofollow">tcpdf PHP class</a> for creating PDFs. Is there any solution to add tooltips to links?</p>

<p>We're in the process of upgrading from IIS 6 and .NET 3.5 to IIS 7.5 (Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise) with the same application.  I'm having trouble getting our previous IIS 6 setup to work correctly.</p>

<p>Under IIS 6, I could set the website itself to use a specific domain user (e.g. ourdomain\webuser) for IIS itself.  This controlled initial access to all files, including HTML, images, etc. and formed the initial request that went to an ASP.NET page wherein then the .NET engine took over and the user running .NET was another domain user (e.g. ourdomain\dotnetuser).  We would then yank all NTFS permissions from one folder (e.g. /lockdown/) for the IIS user, ourdomain\webuser.  Anytime someone tried to access a file in that directory, IIS said "No access, kick into Windows authentication access" and prompt them for credentials.  This still caused any underlying .NET code to run as ourdomain\dotnetuser.</p>

<p>I'm having trouble getting this same setup to work under IIS 7.5 and am sure that it's just some dumb oversight thing.  It...wants to work but doesn't completely.  Here's what I've done:</p>

<p>The application pool for the site is set to .NET Framework v2.0.50727 with "Integrated" selected as the managed pipeline mode option.  Then the identity is set to ourdomain\dotnetuser so that the pool runs as that specific user.</p>

<p>The website is setup to IIS > Authentication to connect as "ourdomain\webuser" and all seems to be well.  The trouble is when I go to this special /lockdown/ directory.  I tried to set it up exactly the same way as IIS 6 (by simply removing access to that folder from ourdomain\webuser).  When I do this, I do get the standard prompt for access, but after providing my credentials, I still get:</p>

<pre>
Error message 401.3: You do not have permission to view this directory 
or page using the credentials you supplied (access denied due to Access 
Control Lists). Ask the Web server's administrator to give you access to

<p>Any suggestions or ideas here?  </p>

<p>On Windows it's not normal that a process terminates once its parent was killed (like Unix-likes do it normally). Therefore there is no direct necessity for something like <code>nohup</code>. If you want to avoid the console window associated with it, you can use <code>javaw</code> but redirection won't work, then.</p>

<p>Fluent APIs are very common these days. Lately, I'm finding them in almost every system I work with. Mostly, they enhance readability but sometimes they lock me in to inflexible specifications, making understanding the runtime behavior of the specification that they build almost impossible. Is there a consensus on how to create a good fluent API? What are the best ways to represent a structure or specification using a fluent API?</p>

<p>I recently noticed this novel variant on the fluent API in the <a href="http://nservicebus.com" rel="nofollow">NServiceBus</a> configuration class:</p>

<pre><code>class EndpointConfig : IConfigureThisEndpoint, AsA_Server { }
</code></pre>

<p>It uses multiple interfaces as a kind of linear fluent interface. I like it because it doesn't place a heavy burden of extra code and context on me when I'm only trying to represent simple requirements. In simple cases that is adequate. I don't imagine it would scale to complex specifications, though. What do you think of this use of interfaces?</p>

<p>What other new idioms are you using in C#? Where do you use them? What are their strengths? Where wouldn't you use them? Also, how would you gauge the strengths of an idiom you were thinking of using?</p>

<p>Making a control aware of its parent is normally a bad idea.  There however is a dedicated method to detect the parent BackColor changing, so it's okay:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

class MyTreeView : TreeView {
    protected override void OnParentChanged(EventArgs e) {
        if (this.Parent != null) this.BackColor = this.Parent.BackColor;
        base.OnParentChanged(e);
    }
    protected override void OnParentBackColorChanged(EventArgs e) {
        this.BackColor = this.Parent.BackColor;
        base.OnParentBackColorChanged(e);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Have a look at <a href="http://www.governmentsecurity.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=20605" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://forum.sysinternals.com/nohup_topic9903.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>How could i add separating line around HBox children component??</p>

<p>like if i choose borderstyle as solid for the hbox, the problem is the line between the children component, like text components, who could i show it in effesent way, not just adding HBox to each element.</p>

<p>You can use <code>AsyncTask</code> to run the function in a separate thread (see <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/painless-threading.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/painless-threading.html</a>)</p>

<p>This is probably a bit unnecessary if you just want to invoke a <code>sleep</code> method, but should work even for other methods that otherwise would block the UI thread.</p>

<p>You could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>private class BackgroundTask extends AsyncTask&lt;Integer, Integer, void&gt; {
    private ProgressDialog dialog;

    @Override
    protected void onPreExecute() {
        dialog = ProgressDialog.show(SettingsActivity.this, "", "Doing stuff...", true);
    }

    @Override
    protected void doInBackground(Integer... params) {
        sleep(params[0]);
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPostExecute(Boolean result) {
        dialog.dismiss();
    }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>And than call it using the code below:</p>

<pre><code>new BackgroundTask().execute(2000);
</code></pre>

<p>Just wrap any text in the xml node with <code>&lt;![CDATA[ ... ]]&gt;</code></p>

<p>is there korean by any chance?</p>

<p><code>+</code> is the adjacent sibling selector.</p>

<p>This <strong>only</strong> selects the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> that comes <strong>immediately after</strong> an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>An illustration:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;Headline!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!-- Selected [1] --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- Not selected [2] --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Another headline!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A quotation.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;!-- Not selected [3] --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Footnotes:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Selected</strong> as it comes right after the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Not selected</strong> as it comes right after the first <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> as opposed to the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Not selected</strong> as it's within a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> and there's no <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> before it inside the quote</li>
</ol>

<p>Hi Every one
in code i can do some thing like this:</p>

<pre><code>container.Register(AllTypes.FromAssemblyNamed("AssemblyName"));
</code></pre>

<p>can i do the same thing using Configuration file "Windsor.Config"???</p>

<p>i have a webhosting that gives maximum memory_limit of 80M (i.e. ini_set("memory_limit","80M");).
I'm using photo upload that uses the function imagecreatefromjpeg();
When i upload large images it gives the error
"Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 83886080 bytes exhausted"
What maximum size (in bytes) for the image i can restrict to the users?
or the memory_limit depends on some other factor?</p>

<p>I have a unique non-clustered index on a sybase table which includes 4 columns:
col1, col2, col3 and col4.</p>

<p>I want to drop one of the columns from the table.</p>

<p>I don't want to drop and recreate the index.</p>

<p>Can I alter the index to not consider this column?</p>

<p>What does your mapping look like exactly?</p>

<p>Do your <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> classes correctly implement <code>hashCode()</code> and <code>equals()</code> so that Hibernate can tell that the <code>A</code> instance pointed to by <code>B</code> is the same instance of the first <code>A</code>?</p>

<p>Sounds like you are trying to model a bi-directional one-to-one mapping - take a look at <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/core/reference/en/html/associations.html#assoc-bidirectional-121" rel="nofollow">the section in the manual on this</a> to see the recommended methods for accomplishing it.</p>

<p>Close the writer.</p>

<p>It selects all <code>p</code> elements that are directly <em>after</em> a <code>h2</code> element in the DOM. Thus, the following <code>p</code> element would be styled:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;A heading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paragraph will be styled.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But this wouldn't:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;A heading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paragraph will NOT be styled.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And neither would this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This paragraph will NOT be styled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A heading&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...or this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h2&gt;A heading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This paragraph will NOT be styled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

<p>I found out about this question recently.</p>

<p>Given a N number range Eg. [1 to 100], sort the numbers in digit order (i.e) For the numbers 1 to 100, the sorted output wound be
1 10 100 11 12 13 . . . 19 2 20 21..... 99</p>

<p>This is just like Radix Sort but just that the digits are sorted in reversed order to what would be done in a normal Radix Sort.</p>

<p>I tried to store all the digits in each number as a linked list for faster operation but it results in a large Space Complexity.</p>

<p>I need a working algorithm for the question. Thanks.</p>

<p>From all the answers, "Converting to Strings" is an option, But is there no other way this can be done??? 
Also An algorithm for Sorting Strings as mentioned above can also be given. Thanks again.</p>

<p>Hello</p>

<p>I have main site to which i put code using require function, but when i add php functions into it, they appear as plain text. The php code is rather long so i won't paste it here. Could anyone help me with that?</p>

<p>Thanks </p>

<p>ok i am adding some code:</p>

<p>require part with only one function:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$content=&lt;&lt;&lt;EOF
echo 'hello';
EOF;
require 'whatever.php';
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and main part:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
echo &lt;&lt;&lt;CONT
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body id="body"&gt;
        &lt;div id="container"&gt;
        $content
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id="add_func"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
CONT;

<p>The memory size of <code>8388608</code> is 8 Megabytes, not 80. You may want to check whether you can still increase the value somewhere.</p>

<p>Other than that, the general rule for image manipulation is that it will take at least</p>

<pre><code>image width x image height x 3 
</code></pre>

<p>bytes of memory to load or create an image. (One byte for red, one byte for green, one byte for blue, possibly one more for alpha transparency)</p>

<p>By that rule, a 640 x 480 pixel image will need at least 9.2 Megabytes of space - not including overhead and space occupied by the script itself.</p>

<p>It's impossible to determine a limit on the JPG file size <em>in bytes</em> because JPG is a compressed format with variable compression rates. You will need to go by image resolution and set a limit on that. </p>

<p>If you don't have that much memory available, you may want to look into more efficient methods of doing what you want, e.g. tiling (processing one part of an image at a time) or, if your provider allows it, using an external tool like <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php" rel="nofollow">ImageMagick</a> (which consumes memory as well, but outside the PHP script's memory limit).</p>

<p>Note that this would be a prime example of using XSLT except that most XSLT processors read in the whole XML file into memory which is not an option as it is large.  Note, however, that the enterprise version of Saxon can do streaming XSLT processing (if the XSLT script adheres to the restrictions).</p>

<p>You may also want to use an external XSLT processor outside your JVM instead, if applicable.  This opens up for several more options.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have an application that uses a database on SQL Server and I want users to connect to that server using integrated windows authentication. The connection string is:</p>

<pre><code>SqlConnection scn = new SqlConnection("Data Source='server name';Initial Catalog=temp;Trusted_Connection=true;Integrated Security=SSPI");
</code></pre>

<p>When I run the application from my pc it works just fine and it recognizes my user name. But when I run it from the server then it gives me the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Login failed for user 'domain\server Name$'.
</code></pre>

<p>As I understand it doesn't recognize the user name and thinks that the user name is the server name.</p>

<p>Any idea how to fix it?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Greg </p>

<p>Make sure that You wrap your code in <code>&lt;?php.....?&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>No need to use the heredoc syntax for what you are doing, you could modify you code like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
  echo 'hello';
  require 'whatever.php';
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body id="body"&gt;
        &lt;div id="container"&gt;
        &lt;?php echo $content; ?&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id="add_func"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is not a job for REs by themselves. You need a scanner to return operators and numbers, and an expression parser. Consider -3-------5.</p>

<p>TinyMCE should pass through any content already in the textarea, so </p>

<pre><code>&lt;textarea name="content" id="content"&gt;Type some text here&lt;/textarea&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>should display that text, then with jQuery you should be able to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>TinyMCE.focus(function(){
 if ($(this).getContent() == "Type some text here"){
  tinyMCE.setContent("");
 } else if ($(this).getContent() == ""){
  tinyMCE.setContent("Type some text here");
 }
})
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't tested it, but getContent &amp; setContent is what you need from the tinyMCE api... not sure if the .focus() will work right. TinyMCE replaces the textarea with an iframe, so you're not actually typing into the textarea anymore...</p>

<p>Maybe this error is not caused by database. </p>

<p>Actually this error often occurs when you have too deep Layout hierarchy. </p>

<p>For 1.5 it could be 13 levels deep. Maybe try to check it with <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/hierarchy-viewer.html" rel="nofollow">Hierarchy Viewer</a>. </p>

<p>Also publishing stack trace might help.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
Stacktrace is pointing clearly that problem lies in your rows layout. When you comment out setting adapter your rows aren't drawn thus error does not occur. </p>

<p>Maybe you are nesting too many <code>LinearLayout</code>'s in your rows? Try to make simple rows - if problem will vanish, you will know what to repair. </p>

<p>Also consider moving from <code>LinearLayout</code> to <code>RelativeLayout</code>. It flattens your view hierarchy. Although take into account that <code>RelativeLayout</code> has some bugs eg. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2850336/relativelayout-differences-between-1-5-and-2-1">RelativeLayout differences between 1.5 and 2.1</a>.</p>

<p>Seems funny to do a POST request, but append the data onto the URL. Either user GET, and <code>escape(whatContent)</code>, or use POST, and pass whatContent as the data parameter.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;

div#float {
    text-align: center;
    float: left;
    width: 150px;
    height: 150px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
    background: gold;
}
div.content {
    background: yellow;
    border: 1px solid  purple;
    height: 150px;
}

&lt;/style&gt;

            &lt;div id='float'&gt;
                Float text. 
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class='content'&gt;
                Content text. 
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div class='content'&gt;
                Content text. 
            &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>can anyone explain how the 2nd div content is on the newline ? while the 1st div is inline with div#float?   </p>

<p>I am pretty sure that only with the fluent configuration API can you set up conventions for your application so that as you create new components you aren’t required to register them individually, as you example shows.</p>

<p>What kind of compilers do big software companies such as Adobe use for their commercial products like Photoshop?</p>

<p>The iPhone UI is so small and crowded that you are usually better off creating a different view/view-controller pair for different UIs. Hiding UI elements leaves gaps that are very noticeable and manually rearranging the UI elements on the fly is a pain. </p>

<p>More importantly, different views communicate to the user that the app is in a different state. You don't want the app to switch to a different state without informing the user. It's hard enough for them to understand what is going on without confusing them with UI slight of hand.</p>

<p>It is very bad UI design to have the same user action present a different UI for no reason discernible to the user. For example, presenting a "a uiwebview at even hours and a form on odd hours" would be a fantastically bad idea because the user would have no idea why clicking on a specific button sometimes gets them a web view and a form view other times. Do you expect the user to check the clock before clicking so that they know what to expect?</p>

<p>If some UI element is unavailable for some reason e.g. no network access, then it's better UI design to present the element as disabled instead of disappearing it. The interface grammar teaches users that grayed out controls are temporarily unavailable. That is much less confusing that a constantly changing UI. </p>

<p>Hi everyone, I'm trying to enable shake gestures within my application but I'm having a problem. </p>

<p>I have different view controllers, but on one of them (not the main view controller for the application) nothing happens in response to a shake gesture.  What could be the problem? </p>

<p>The relevant code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>-(BOOL)canBecomeFirstResponder {
    return YES;
}

-(void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [super viewDidAppear:animated];
    [self becomeFirstResponder];
}


-(void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event

{
    if (event.subtype == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake)
    {


 NSLog (@"SHAKED");

    }
}

<p>It isn't specifically geared toward web-development, but a big portion of the stuff you're seeking is covered in good detail in <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/freelancer1" rel="nofollow">The Principles Of Successful Freelancing</a>.</p>

<p>A good way is to use the composite pattern as Gordon says. A simple implementation of this could be :</p>

<pre>
interface SitePart {
  function getName();
}

class Page implements SitePart {
  function Page($name,$content) { ... }
  function getName() { ... }
  function getContent() { ... }
}

class Category implements SitePart {
  private $parts = array()
  function Category($name) { ... }
  function getName() { ... }
  function add(SitePart $part) { $this->parts[$part->name] = $part }
  function get($partName) { return $this->parts[$name] }
}

class Site extends Category {
  function Site($name) { ... }
}
</pre>

<p>For creating your hierarchy and pages :</p>

<pre>
Site
 Categ 1
  Page 1
  Categ 1.1
 Categ 2
</pre>

<pre>
$site = new Site();

$categ1 = new Category('Categ 1');
$categ11 = new Category('Categ 1.1');
$categ2 = new Category('Categ 2');

$site->add($categ1);
$site->add($categ2);
$categ1->add($categ11);

$categ1->add(new Page('Page 1','Hello world');
</pre>

<p>And now to retrieve page 1 for example :</p>

<pre>
$page = $site->get('Categ 1')->get('Page 1');
echo $page->getContent();
</pre>

<p>I hope that will help you.</p>

<p>Thank you so much Patrick. I have been trying to figure this out for ages and this was the one thing that worked.</p>

<p>Use any sorting algorithm you like, but compare the numbers <em>as strings</em>, not as numbers. This is basically lexiographic sorting of regular numbers. Here's an example gnome sort in C:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

void sort(int* array, int length) {
    int* iter = array;
    char buf1[12], buf2[12];
    while(iter++ &lt; array+length) {
        if(iter == array || (strcmp(itoa(*iter, &amp;buf1, 10), itoa(*(iter-1), &amp;buf2, 10) &gt;= 0) {
            iter++;
        } else {
            *iter ^= *(iter+1);
            *(iter+1) ^= *iter;
            *iter ^= *(iter+1);
            iter--;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this requires the non-standard <code>itoa</code> function to be present in <code>stdlib.h</code>. A more standard alternative would be to use <code>sprintf</code>, but that makes the code a little more cluttered. You'd possibly be better off converting the whole array to strings first, then sort, then convert it back.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For reference, the relevant bit here is <code>strcmp(itoa(*iter, &amp;buf1, 10), itoa(*(iter-1), &amp;buf2, 10) &gt;= 0</code>, which replaces <code>*iter &gt;= *(iter-1)</code>.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm using app engine patch for an application on app engine. I have a model formset which works great for editing objects, but I can't use it for adding objects because I can't create an empty formset. </p>

<p>I want the user to be able to add multiple records at once, which I was I am using formsets.</p>

<p>In django, to create an empty formset I can set the queryset using the following: FooFormSet(queryset=Foo.objects.none()).
I'm not sure what the equivalent is in app engine. 
I've tried creating a query that returns nothing e.g. Foo.all().filter('bar =', 'variableThatDoesNotExist'), but the formset then uses all the Foo records.
I've tried fetch(0) but this also makes the formset use all Foo records.</p>

<p>Is there any workaround for this? </p>

<p>I may create a regular form, let the user enter the data and submit the form, and then return formset to continue editing/adding additional objects. It doesn't seem very elegant, but I'm not sure about what other way to try.</p>

<p>If someone has a nicer solution, please let me know. </p>

<p>Thanks
Bert</p>

<p>You could use the Windows <code>start</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>start /min java -jar spider.jar
</code></pre>

<p>This command is not really the same as <code>nohup</code>; but it might be suitable if you're happy with the Java process running in a separate minimised window. See <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds.mspx</a></p>

<p>i think if you convert numbers to string, you can use string comparison to sort them.
you can use anny sorting alghorighm for it.</p>

<p>"1" &lt; "10" &lt; "100" &lt; "11" ...</p>

<p>I have a solution but not exactly an algorithm.. All you need to do is converts all the numbers to strings &amp; sort them as strings..</p>

<p>Microsoft uses VC for most of its products. GNU like software is compiled using GCC. Some scientific intensive software is compiled using Intel compilers.</p>

<p>I must be doing something wrong obviously.
My delegate doesn't get called when I set the frame of a view.</p>

<p>Frame version NOT working</p>

    [[[currentViewController view] animator] setFrame:currentTarget];
    [[[newViewController view] animator] setFrame:newTarget];
}

    [anim setDelegate:self];
    [[currentViewController view] setAnimations:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:anim forKey:@"alphaValue"]];
    [[newViewController view] setAnimations:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:anim forKey:@"alphaValue"]];

    [[[currentViewController view] animator] setAlphaValue:0.5];
    [[[newViewController view] animator] setAlphaValue:0.5];
}

- (void)animationDidStop:(CAAnimation *)animation finished:(BOOL)flag {
    NSLog(@"Yep; works!");

Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Hello All,</p>

<p>I have a friend who is quite a capable programmer, especially considering that he is blind.  Now he would like to start developing for Android.  But, the problem I see him running into is that there appears to be no accessibility features for the Android emulator.  Ideally he would be able to have his computer read the contents of the Android emulation screen to him.  However, at least from what I've seen, the contents of the Android screen and the buttons that can be used to manipulate the emulation Android etc. are all invisible to a screen reader.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a workaround for this?</p>

<hr>

<p>UPDATE:  I found what looks like a promising resource <a href="http://eyes-free.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/tutorial/tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  It's a Text-to-Speech library for Android developed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._V._Raman" rel="nofollow">T. V. Raman</a> of Google.  I'm still looking for more information from the community though.</p>

<p>The first <code>&lt;div class='content'&gt;</code> is 150px tall, the same as the <code>#float</code> one, so it's pushed down exactly one line.  If you wanted the <code>#float</code> to "span" both lines, give it more height, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>div#float {
    text-align: center;
    float: left;
    width: 150px;
    height: 300px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
    background: gold;
}
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/nick_craver/fPSt9/" rel="nofollow">You can try it out here</a>.</p>

<p>You can't create a static unit of work, because by definition a unit of work is a short lived object. Because the EF <code>ObjectContext</code> is designed around the unit of work pattern it is a bad idea to have a single <code>ObjectContext</code> instance during the life time of the application. There are several reasons for this. </p>

<p>First of all, the <code>ObjectContext</code> class is not thread-safe. This means that during the unit of work of one user (in a web app for instance), another user can commit his unit of work. When they share the same <code>ObjectContext</code>, it means that in that situation just half of the changes are persisted and changes are not transactional. When you are lucky the <code>ObjectContext</code> fails and throws an exception. When you are unlucky, you corrupt the <code>ObjectContext</code> and safe and load crap from and to your database and find out when your application is running in production (of course, during testing and staging everything always seems to work).</p>

<p>Second, the <code>ObjectContext</code> has a caching mechanism that is designed for it to be short lived. When an entity is retrieved from the database it stays in the <code>ObjectContext</code>’s cache until that instance is garbage collected. When you keep that instance alive for a long period of time, entities get stale. Especially if that particular <code>ObjectContext</code> instance is not the only one writing to that database.</p>

<p>The second div is displayed as a block-element. Block elements have a width of 100%, so there is no room left for the first div to appear on the left size of your second div.</p>

<p>A friend has asked me this, and I couldn't answer.</p>

<p>He asked: I am making this site where you can archive your site...</p>

<p>It works like this, you enter your site like, something.com and then our site grabs the content on that website like images, and all that and uploads it to our site. Then people can view an exact copy of the site at oursite.com/something.com even if the server that is holding up something.com is down.</p>

<p>How could he do this? (php?) and what would be some requirements?</p>

<p>I'm looking for a javascript charting library that can display interactive bar graphs on a  timeline, similar to the timeline in Thunderbird's search window.</p>

<p>There are many <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1890434/javascript-library-for-drawing-graphs-over-timelines-zoomable-and-selectable" title="javascript libraries to create timelines with line charts">javascript libraries to create timelines with line charts</a>, but my data requires a bar chart.</p>

<p>Which library should I use  to display my bar graphs interactivly on a timeline?
What is your personal suggestion? </p>

<p>Use <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490994.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>runas</code></a> to have the application run with the correct credentials.</p>

<p>By default, divs will take up the entire width of the block.  Your first one is just beginning after the floated div because that's where it can begin.  Since both your content divs are block-level elements, they will take up the entire width available to them.</p>

<p>There are lots of ways to control this, but I'm not sure what you're after.</p>

<p>You can use <code>git rebase -i</code> to “squash” some commits together, so that the intermediates won't be in the repository anymore, and then <code>git push -f</code> it onto the server. But rebasing causes problems if others use the same repository.</p>

<p>Also, the original revisions and files associated with them will be actually deleted from the repository only after garbage collection is done (I think you can't do that remotely, but it should happen automatically) <em>and</em> they are no longer referenced from the reflog (entries stay there 90 days on default).</p>

<p>i have the following code to use reflection to read a bunch of data.</p>

<pre><code>    protected virtual string GetChange(TBase newVersion, TBase oldVersion)
    {

        foreach (var propertyInfo in typeof(TBase).GetProperties(BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance))
        {
            if (typeof(IEnumerable).IsAssignableFrom(propertyInfo.PropertyType)) continue;

            var oldValue = propertyInfo.GetValue(oldVersion, null);
            var newValue = propertyInfo.GetValue(newVersion, null);
            if (!Equals(oldValue, newValue))
            {
                stringBuilder.AppendFormat("[{0}]: from '{1}' to '{2}'&lt;br /&gt;",
                                           propertyInfo.Name, oldValue, newValue);
            }
</code></pre>

<p>this is throwing an exception on this line:</p>

<pre><code>            var oldValue = propertyInfo.GetValue(oldVersion, null);
</code></pre>

<p>because the property is null apparently.  Is there anyway to have this not throw an exception and just return null?  Is there any other way to check to avoid any exceptions here?</p>

<p>Now suppose that I have an <code>XmlNode timeNode</code> that points to <code>&lt;Cube time="2010-05-28"&gt;</code> node and a <code>document</code> that points to the loaded XML document. Lets say I need to get the value of the <code>rate</code> attribute in the <code>&lt;Cube currency=USD" rate="1.2384"/&gt;</code> node by calling a <code>SelectSingleNode(string xpath)</code> method.</p>

<p>So far I was able to come up with this code:<br/></p>

<pre><code>XmlNamespaceManager nsmgr = new XmlNamespaceManager(document.NameTable);
nsmgr.AddNamespace("ecb", "http://www.ecb.int/vocabulary/2002-08-01/eurofxref");
nsmgr.AddNamespace("gesmes", "http://www.gesmes.org/xml/2002-08-01");


XmlNode currencyNode = timeNode.SelectSingleNode("descendant::ecb:Cube[@ecb:currency='USD']", nsmgr);

string rate = currencyNode.Attributes.GetNamedItem("rate").Value;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is that <code>currencyNode</code> is set to null here. I've checked the <code>timeNode</code> and it points to the correct node, so I guess the problem is with the path in the <code>SelectSingleNode</code> method, yet I fail to see where the problem is. I've checked other posts with similar problem but couldn't find anything that would solve mines. Any pointers will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Use wget. Either the linux version or the windows version from the gnuwin32 package. <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm" rel="nofollow">get it here</a>.</p>

<p>Hi,
In Visual Studio 2010, I'm trying to build an COM-interop enabled C# project without registering it during build, but I <em>DO</em> require the assembly's typelibrary (.tlb) file, so I can import it from another C++ project in the solution.</p>

<p>I haven't found a way of doing this - there once upon a time was a tlbexp.exe tool, but it was deprecated in favor of regasm.exe /tlb (which unlike tlbexp.exe, registers it).</p>

<p>Hi Guys.</p>

<p>Is there any jquery event which is called when the readonly value of the text box is changed automatically</p>

<p>I want to  call an event (jquery) which should be called when the readonly value of the textbox is changed some how by other jquery events.</p>

<p>Early Reply is highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Best Regards,
Sagar</p>

<p>try switching the "display" css property to "inline-style"</p>

<p>Dear Sirs</p>

<p>I would like to know if it is possible to use [] in SQLite query as we used to in Access and other DB.</p>

<p>e.g. SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE fwords like '%b[e,i,a]d%'</p>

<p>this will retrieve all rows have fwords containing bad, bed, bid</p>

<p>Thanks a lot</p>

<p>A <code>HBox</code> is just a box with a horizontal layout of children - it doesn't actually have vertical lines running between those children, so you're not going to be able to use borders or anything on the HBox.</p>

<p>Your best bet is probably adding <code>VRule</code> components in between each child component, something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;mx:HBox width="100%" borderColor="#000000" borderStyle="solid"&gt;
    &lt;mx:Image /&gt;
    &lt;mx:VRule height="100%" strokeColor="#000000" strokeWidth="1"/&gt;
    &lt;mx:Image /&gt;
    &lt;mx:VRule height="100%" strokeColor="#000000" strokeWidth="1"/&gt;
    &lt;mx:Image /&gt;
&lt;/mx:HBox&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can adjust the VRule and HBox border styles to be consistent however you like. The only other options I can think of are to put borders around each child component with no border on the HBox (may need child padding depending on your components), embed all your components in <code>Box</code> components within the HBox like you suggest, or doing something completely crazy like using a <code>HorizontalList</code> and embedding your components in a custom item renderer that is a consistent size with a border.</p>

<p>Personally I'd just use VRule separators and move on. I'd rather double up on children than have all my components of interest one family level deeper in the HBox. If you need to generate your HBox children from a variable array or suchlike, then you may want to put each one in a <code>Box</code> and use a <code>Repeater</code> or something. Some more detail would help for more specific answers.</p>

<p>I want to have a program like this:</p>

<pre><code>scanf("%s", name);
scanf("%s", id);
scanf("%d", &amp;age);
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to write <code>name</code>, <code>id</code> and <code>age</code> to a file, but the file should be encrypted, so that only my program can read back the data it wrote.</p>

<p>Do I need to use one of the encryption libraries <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/180870/what-is-the-best-encryption-library-in-c-c">mentioned here</a> (they all are pretty heavy duty libraries, I just need to encrypt a text file), or is there any other simpler method?</p>

<p>If an encryption library is the solution, which one is best suited for a simple text file encryption?</p>

<p>using class and type as fields in the model.... not a good move</p>

<p>Ok, this one is a non technical question. I am creating a business directory and I'd like to categorize listings by location. Instead of giving users an option to enter the location, I am going to provide them with a list of locations which follow a Country/State/City format. I tried GeoWorldMap by GeoBytes. It looked promising in the beginning and I felt that is exactly what would get the job done until I realized it provided a list of around 275 countries even though the number of countries that are recognized is between 192 to 195. So I am not sure about the <em>extra 80 countries</em>. When I realized this issue, I went to their website to do some reckon and found out that their list is updated on a regular basis. So this brings a question to my mind. Is it possible to find an accurate database that lists all possible locations? What do most developers here use for something like this?</p>

<p>It sounds like you need to create a webcrawler. Web crawlers can be written in any language, although I would recommend using C++ (using cURL), Java (using URLConnection), or Python (w/ urrlib2) for that. You could probably also hack something quickly together with the curl or wget commands and BASH, although that is probably not the best long-term solution. Also, don't forget that you should download, parse, and respect the "robots.txt" file if it is present whenever you crawl someone's website.</p>

<p>There is no event for this (not one you would want to attach to, a general DOM change event handler would have <em>horrible</em> performance).</p>

<p>If you expanded on the context a bit, there may be another solution to get what you're after, for example what's setting it to readonly?</p>

<p>Edit: I missed that it's a contiguous range. That being the case, all the answers which talk about sorting an array are wrong (including your idea stated in the question that it's like a radix sort), and True Soft's answer is right.</p>

<p><i>just like Radix Sort but just that the digits are sorted in reversed order</i></p>

<p>Well spotted :-) If you actually do it that way, funnily enough, it's called an MSD radix sort.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort#Most_significant_digit_radix_sorts" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort#Most_significant_digit_radix_sorts</a></p>

<p>You can implement one very simply, or with a lot of high technology and fanfare. In most programming languages, your particular example faces a slight difficulty. Extracting decimal digits from the natural storage format of an integer, isn't an especially fast operation. You can ignore this and see how long it ends up taking (recommended), or you can add yet more fanfare by converting all the numbers to decimal strings before sorting.</p>

<p>Of course you don't have to implement it as a radix sort: you could use a comparison sort algorithm with an appropriate comparator. For example in C, the following is suitable for use with qsort (unless I've messed it up):</p>

<pre><code>int lex_compare(void *a, void *b) {
    char a_str[12];  // assuming 32bit int
    char b_str[12];
    sprintf(a_str, "%d", *(int*)a);
    sprintf(b_str, "%d", *(int*)b);
    return strcmp(a_str,b_str);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Not terribly efficient, since it does a lot of repeated work, but straightforward.</p>

<p>would the change() method not work?</p>

<pre><code>$('input:readonly').change(function() {
   alert("Readonly input changed!!");
})
</code></pre>

<p>Better use a symmetric-key algorithm, as AES. You can find small sourcecodes <a href="http://www.lomont.org/Software/Misc/AES/AES.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> for instance.</p>

<p>If your applications are critical, then you should use the libraries you linked to.</p>

<p>I've used jQuery <strong><a href="http://code.google.com/p/flot/" rel="nofollow">flot</a></strong> quite a bit in the past and in combination with <strong><a href="http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">excanvas</a></strong>, it renders nice interactive charts in all modern browsers. </p>

<p>There are also hooks into the rendering process that allow you to modify how charts are rendered too, if you find that the base script doesn't quite fit with what you require.</p>

<p>Simplest example using the Standard Library. </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  char c = 'n';
  cout &lt;&lt; "HEX " &lt;&lt; hex &lt;&lt; (int)c &lt;&lt; endl;  // output in hexadecimal
  cout &lt;&lt; "ASC" &lt;&lt; c &lt;&lt; endl; // output in ascii
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To check the output, <a href="http://codepad.org/IoEn7bQc" rel="nofollow">codepad</a> returns: 6e </p>

<p>and an online <a href="http://www.dolcevie.com/js/converter.html" rel="nofollow">ascii-to-hexadecimal conversion tool</a> yields 6e as well. So it works.</p>

<p>You can also do this:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;class T&gt; std::string toHexString(const T&amp; value, int width) {
    std::ostringstream oss;
    oss &lt;&lt; hex;
    if (width &gt; 0) {
        oss &lt;&lt; setw(width) &lt;&lt; setfill('0');
    }
    oss &lt;&lt; value;
    return oss.str();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've written a program in C# to share the desktop between two win7 computer stations, the Sharer and the Viewer.</p>

<p>When I Start sharing it all works right: The viewer displays the sharer's desktop and the remote mouse follows the local mouse when it moves. (I'm using interactive mode.) But when I try to click anywhere, it stops the remote mouse from interacting with the local mouse. Or the input redirection is stopped.</p>

<p>More annoying, it work normally rarely, but I don't know why.</p>

<p>Since you're parsing XML with regular expressions (not a good idea in the general case), I assume you are willing to make a few assumptions about your input. If so, the following substitution might be good enough.</p>

<p>It replaces minus signs with plus signs, provided that the minus sign is: (a) at a word boundary, and (b) followed by some optional non-left-angle-bracket-text and then a close tag. No need to worry about the start tag if we can assume a valid document. The second condition is enforced with a look-ahead assertion so that the regular expression won't consume the string, allowing you to replace all such minus signs.</p>

<pre><code>s/ \b- (?= [^&lt;]* &lt;\/h&gt;) /+/xg;
</code></pre>

<p>Another option is to run your regex until it fails to replace anything. In a scalar context a global substitution returns the number of replacements made, which can serve as your test for when to stop processing a line:</p>

<pre><code>my $n = 1;
$n = s/YOUR_REGEX/YOUR_REPLACE/g while $n;
</code></pre>

<p>The representation of your map's iterator is totally up to you. I think it should suffice to use a single wrapped pointer to a <code>node</code>. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
struct mymapiterator
{
  typename mymap&lt;T&gt;::node * n;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Or something similar. Now, <code>mymap::begin()</code> could return such instance of the iterator that <code>n</code> would point to the leftmost node. <code>mymap::end()</code> could return instance with <code>n</code> pointing to root probably or some other special node from which it is still possible to get back to rightmost node so that it could satisfy bidirectional iteration from end iterator.</p>

<p>The operation of moving between the nodes (<code>operators++()</code> and <code>operator--()</code>, etc.) are about traversing the tree from smaller to bigger values or vice versa. Operation that you probably have already implemented during insertion operation implementation.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The LIKE operator does a pattern matching comparison. The operand to the right of the LIKE operator contains the pattern and the left hand operand contains the string to match against the pattern. A percent symbol ("%") in the LIKE pattern matches any sequence of zero or more characters in the string. An underscore ("_") in the LIKE pattern matches any single character in the string. Any other character matches itself or its lower/upper case equivalent (i.e. case-insensitive matching). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that help?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have created an application that read messages with voice. I would like to pause any running media player when a message arrives in order to make the voice more clear. Is there any intent that could achieve this aim? I have noticed that google navigator, for example, is able to pause media player (and other music app like pandora).</p>

<p>While 96MB is rediculous for an average site, it is not unseen when running many modules in Drupal.</p>

<p>However, the error states that it went over 16M, so obviously the value as stated in your phpinfo() is not loaded correctly.</p>

<p>Best place to set values such as memory-limits are in the vhost configuraiton itself. 
Second best place is the .htaccess
Third best place is in settings.php.</p>

<p>I assume you have either a low value (16M) in your settings.php /or/ in .htaccess. Best is to set them in the vhost config and remove them from other places. </p>

<p>You can see the actual values available in Drupal with devel.module, which has a simple php-info() page. Alternatively, you can create a node with PHP-parsing as filter and insert a phpinfo() there. That will show you the actual values as available in Drupal.</p>

<p>I'm assuming the problem you're trying to solve here is how to include properties from multiple levels in a nested object-- some properties from the top level but other properties from the lower level. One easy way to do this is to transform the inner collection into a new type which contains a mix of all the properties you need. </p>

<p>Here's a code sample illustrating this technique using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb548891.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>IEnumerable.Select</code></a> and C# Anonymous Classes to create a new class:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Title="Home Page" Language="C#" %&gt;

<p>Yes you can but I would strongly recommend against it if you don't have to. It's fiddly and it feels like you need to sort out your dependencies better.</p>

<p>To do it, you have to use <code>LIB.EXE</code> to create an import library from the object files of one binary before you actually link it; use this import library to link other binary and create an import library for the other binary; finally use the other library's import library to link the original binary.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<p>exe.c:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void __declspec(dllimport) dllfn(void);

void __declspec(dllexport) exefn(void)
{
    puts("Hello, world!");
}

int main(void)
{
    dllfn();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compiler with <code>cl /c exe.c</code>. <code>exe.obj</code> is created.</p>

<p>exe.def:</p>

<pre><code>LIBRARY exe.exe
</code></pre>

<p>Create import library with <code>lib /def:exe.def exe.obj</code>. <code>exe.lib</code> and <code>exe.exp</code> are created.</p>

<p>dll.c:</p>

<pre><code>void __declspec(dllimport) exefn(void);

void __declspec(dllexport) dllfn(void)
{
    exefn();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Compile with <code>cl /c dll.c</code>. <code>dll.obj</code> is created.</p>

<p>Link DLL with <code>link /dll dll.obj exe.lib</code>. <code>dll.dll</code>, <code>dll.lib</code> and <code>dll.exp</code> are created.</p>

<p>Link EXE with <code>link exe.obj dll.lib</code>. <code>exe.exe</code> is created. (<code>exe.lib</code> and <code>exe.exp</code> are also recreated.)</p>

<p>Run exe, note the <code>Hello, world!</code> output.</p>

<p>If you want security, it is a mistake to roll your own encryption library. Use a well established encryption library (even if it may seem bloated), and leave security and its proper implementation to the experts.</p>

<p>If you can use C++, I suggest <a href="http://www.cryptopp.com/" rel="nofollow">Crypto++</a>, and if you can't use C++, then I suggest you implement a C wrapper library around <a href="http://www.cryptopp.com/" rel="nofollow">Crypto++</a>. Another possibility is <a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/crypto.html" rel="nofollow">libcrypto</a>, although it lacks support for AES.</p>

<p>I should warn you, though, that if the program and the text file are on the same machine, you will need to have the password supplied externally (e.g. by the user); passwords that are embedded in programs are easily extracted, and offer no security at all. If the program is inaccessible (e.g. it is located on  a webserver, and someone with the text file won't have access to the executable), then it is ok.</p>

<p>I'm trying to think of a way to place Flash content into a blog post so that it appears inline between paragraphs. I'm writing a custom weblog application in Django (still learning) and I'll be using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/" rel="nofollow">SWFObject</a> for the embedding. </p>

<p>The blog is for me only so the back-end isn't too fancy. I'm simply using Django's built in admin interface. No TinyMCE rich text editor (like Wordpress), rather I've implemented <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" rel="nofollow">Markdown</a>.</p>

<p>I'd like to add Flash content into the body of a post, between paragraphs, in a way that is not coupled to any third party script. Meaning, I would prefer not to include javascript within the body of the blog post as it introduces a dependency on SWFObject. For example, I could quite easily add the following to an entry via the back-end to embed a SWF inline:</p>

<pre><code>Paragraph one...

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
swfobject.embedSWF("/path/to/flash.swf", "myContent", "200", "200", "9.0.0");
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div id="myContent"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Paragraph two...
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see this is quite wordy and a lot to remember but it also refers to SWFObject directly. This WILL work, however I would prefer to write it in a "cleaner" more abstract way. What I was thinking of doing is creating my own parser which would translate a custom string into the above just before rendering a template.</p>

<pre><code>[#SWF swf="/path/to/flash.swf" w="200" h="200" ver="9.0.0"]
</code></pre>

<p>I'm wondering if anyone has encountered this issue. I'd love to know how you solved it.</p>

<p>You could add a function that will be executed every <code>N</code> seconds (via <code>setInterval</code>) and check for the field value. It is very ugly, though. </p>

<p>just get rid of heredoc    </p>

<p>require part </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
echo 'hello';
require 'whatever.php';
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>main part</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body id="body"&gt;
        &lt;div id="container"&gt;
        &lt;?php echo $content ?&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id="add_func"&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>that's all<br>
PHP is not Perl, heredoc is useless here, even if properly used.
Just never use this ugly syntax.</p>

<p>Hi,
Recently I started taking <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/" rel="nofollow">this guide</a> to get myself started on downloading files from the internet. I read it and came up with the following code to download the HTTP body of a website. The only problem is, it's not working. The code stops when calling the recv() call. It does not crash, it just keeps on running. Is this my fault? Am I using the wrong approch?

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm wondering what is the best method to handle AJAX calls with jQuery? Right now I'm doing something like following:</p>

<pre><code>$("#test").live('click', function(){
    // Process form
    $.ajax({
        type: "post",
        url: "test.php",
        success: function(html){
            if(html.success == 0) {
                alert('Error');
            } else {
                var obj = $.parseJSON(html.rows);
                $("#success").html(obj[0].name);
            }
        },
        dataType:'json'
    }); 
    return false;
});
</code></pre>

<p>In test.php file, I'm checking if request is an AJAX request. If it's an AJAX request I'm running a database query to get some data (this part isn't important in this question, I think):</p>

<pre><code>// query goes here
if(mysql_num_rows($query) &gt; 0 ) {
    $result['success'] = 1;
    $result['data'] = json_encode($data);
} else {
    $result['success'] = 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I'm wondering if my method is the best possible? FYI I'm using KohanaPHP framework currently, so I want to not break MVC "rules". If I'm doing it wrong, do you have any tips and suggestions how to handle AJAX calls in controllers?</p>

<p>Regards,
Tom</p>

<p>i am using EventTrigger in silverlight application to handle some events through MVVM model, trigger is working fine on the layoutroot controls, but there are some controls inside the pages resources but the trigger is not working with them :( </p>

<p>is there anything i should add or change the namespace or something ?
here is my code </p>

<pre><code>&lt;i:Interaction.Triggers&gt;
   &lt;i:EventTrigger EventName="Loaded"&gt;
       &lt;i:InvokeCommandAction Command="{Binding mediaElement_LoadedCommand}" CommandParameter="{Binding ElementName=mediaElement,Mode=OneWay}"&gt; &lt;/i:InvokeCommandAction&gt;
   &lt;/i:EventTrigger&gt;
&lt;/i:Interaction.Triggers&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You could add a change event to your <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> and test for the readonly attribute:</p>

<pre><code>$('input').change(function(){
    if($(this).attr('readonly') == true){
        // do something fancy
    } 
});
</code></pre>

<p>My solution isn't exactly what you want to do, but it might help.. When I run into similar issues, I usually create a (temp) DB for the schema compare &amp; use it instead of my project..</p>

<p>For a simple text file that you read / write in one go I'd use a stream cipher, e.g. RC4.</p>

<p>Assuming you're using an embedded secret key RC4 is easy enough to implement yourself, or there should be plenty of lightweight implementations out there.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that you're using a graphical emacs, and not just using the OS X bundled version from within Terminal.</p>

<p>To ensure that Emacs responds to keystrokes in the same way as other OS X apps, try the following:</p>

<pre><code>(setq default-input-method "MacOSX")
</code></pre>

<p>And in particular, if you want to use the Option key to enter extended characters not on your keyboard (e.g. "Option-c c" => "ç"), use these settings:</p>

<pre><code>(setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
(setq mac-option-modifier 'none)
</code></pre>

<p>(Put these commands in your ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el emacs startup file, and restart Emacs, or just "M-x eval-buffer" while editing the file.)</p>

<p>Apparently <code>findViewById(R.id.stub_exposure);</code> returns null for you. Did you recompile your class properly to regenerate the R.java file?</p>

<p>Also, I noticed you defined one of your text view's text property in your view stub layout XML file as <code>android:text="@+String/hello"</code>.</p>

<p>Don't know if it's just a typo or not, but has the <code>R.java</code> been properly generated? If you have an existing value in <code>strings.xml</code> (notice not uppercase) then the compiler should complain.</p>

<p>You should try to do a Project -> Clean to see if you get warnings or errors (if you're using Eclipse).</p>

<p>You can have a look at the regex section <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>XML attributes don't have the a namespace by default, so you don't need to use the namespace prefix on them.  Try just: </p>

<pre><code>XmlNode currencyNode = timeNode.SelectSingleNode("descendant::ecb:Cube[@currency='USD']", nsmgr);
</code></pre>

<p>You also don't need to explicitly specify the descendant axis here since it will look at children by default, so you could also shorten it to: </p>

<pre><code>XmlNode currencyNode = timeNode.SelectSingleNode("ecb:Cube[@currency='USD']", nsmgr);
</code></pre>

<p>What you have looks good here, though I don't think you need a <code>$.parseJSON()</code> there, it should already be an object at that point, this should work:</p>

<pre><code>$("#success").html(html.rows[0].name);
</code></pre>

<p>As a side note, from a readability/maintainability perspective, I'd rename your <code>html</code> argument to be <code>data</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>success: function(data) {
</code></pre>

<p>This is purely preference, but using <code>html</code> when it's an HTML type response, and <code>data</code> or something else when it's JSON/already an object you're expecting keeps things a bit easier to read for outsiders.</p>

<p>Not sure if you'r doing an assignment or trying to learn enterprise technologies in Java or something else. If it's about the first two cases then you must take a look at Spring, Hibernate, Maven to quickly build something:</p>

<p>1) If you want to do it yourself, take a look at this tutorial series [link text][1]</p>

<p>2) You can also do a quick app using Spring Roo (but if you'r new to the platform, then try doing everything yourself so you could learn something). </p>

<p>[1]: <a href="http://www.nabeelalimemon.com/blog/2010/05/spring-3-integrated-with-hibernate-part-a/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nabeelalimemon.com/blog/2010/05/spring-3-integrated-with-hibernate-part-a/</a> Spring, Hibernate, Maven tutorial</p>

<p>You have to send an HTTP request before expecting a response.
You code currently just waits for a response which never comes.</p>

<p>Also, don't write comments in all caps.</p>

<p>I have the same problem could anyone please answer ??</p>

<p>Do you need strong encryption? Do the people you are protecting the file from have access to the executable and have the skills to disassemble and analyse it? Do hey have cryptanalytic skills? If not, you can use very simple XOR-based cipher.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a program to generate a LONG random string of characters, e.g "837es238aj983", but longer than any string you may read from input (it does not need to be readable).</li>
<li>Generate a random integer.</li>
<li>Store the random string and integer as global variables in your C program.</li>
<li>XOR each age you read with your random integer and save the XORed value to the file.</li>
<li>XOR each character in the strings you read from input with the character at the same index in your random string. Save the XORed value to the file.</li>
<li>When you read the values from file, you XOR again with your random keys and obtain the original values.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hi, </p>

<p>I am trying to use a WebView in my Android application. I am creating my webview in code-side (not in XML). My problem is; when I call loadUrl method of webview, the webview goes fullscreen mode. How can I keep the size of the webview for example 200x200 pixels?</p>

<p>If there is any other option instead of webview, of course welcome :)</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>The problem is, you have to implement the HTTP protocol. Downloading a file is not just a matter of connecting to the server, you have to send HTTP requests (along with proper HTTP header) before you get a response. After this, you would still need to parse the returned data to strip out more HTTP headers.</p>

<p>If you're just trying to download files using C, I suggest the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/" rel="nofollow">cURL library</a>, which does the HTTP work for you.</p>

<pre><code>a=[[true, true, false],
   [false, true, true],
   [false, true, true]]

a.transpose.map{|c|c.count(true)}
</code></pre>

<p>sneaky way of saving one more character</p>

<pre><code>a.transpose.map{|c|c.count(!!0)}
</code></pre>

<p>As Jonas points out it is possible to golf this some more</p>

<pre><code>a.transpose.map{|c|c.count !!0}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm at a loss here. I have this class I've created that takes arguments in object form:</p>

<pre><code>new Widget('id_of_element', { option1: 'foo', option2: 'bar' });
</code></pre>

<p>However, the second argument isn't being seen as a hash, but as an object, so I can't apply default settings to if one is not set:</p>

<pre><code>initialize: function (element, options) {
    this.options = $H({ option1: 'something', option2: 'else', option3: 'hello', option4: 100 }).update(options);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I need the vales from the argument 'options' to be converted into a Hash, so I can use the update() function. I can't find anything in the Prototype framework that will cast an object as a Hash.</p>

<p>What's strange is, on this.options.inspect(), all the correct values show up, but when I call it:</p>

<pre><code>alert(this.options.option1);
// or 
alert(this.options['option1']);
</code></pre>

<p>... they come back as undefined. Why would the Hash#inspect method find these values, but are still undefined? Am I missing some substantial understanding of some type?</p>

<p>I've solved the issue, see <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/ujTDf/3/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/ujTDf/3/</a>. Be sure to read the capitalized comments! Sorry for yelling, but they're very important.</p>

<p>Accidentally found the condition that was preventing Intellisense:</p>

<p>The original page had a code block:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%
=paymentAmt%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>At one point during my editing I collapsed that whitespace for sake of readability to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%=paymentAmt%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Intellisense highlighting reappeared. </p>

<p>So you have a list of strings, each consisting entirely of a user name optionally enclosed in HTML tags?  It shouldn't matter which tags they are; just remove anything that <em>looks</em> like a tag:</p>

<pre><code>name = Regex.Replace(name, @"&lt;/?\w+[^&lt;&gt;]*&gt;", String.Empty);
</code></pre>

<p>i am using <code>Zend_Navigation</code> i want to show the nav item in the breadcrumbs but hide it in my menu, how can i do that? </p>

<p><code>Eval("foo")</code> is a shortcut for <code>DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "foo")</code>. Container.DataItem contains the actual data you're trying to get at, and the <code>Eval()</code> method simply uses reflection or other means to allow late binding on names. </p>

<p>If you want better compile-time type checking, you can always cast the <code>Container.DataItem</code> to whatever type you want. </p>

<p>You can also re-use <code>DataBinder.Eval()</code> elsewhere, as a shortcut for using Reflection.</p>

<p>Some examples of what you can do are below:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%# DoSomethingWithData (DataBinder.Eval(Container.DataItem, "Foo")) %&gt;

Sub DoSomethingWithData (Object data)
   SomeProperty = data
   DoSomethingWithData = data
End Sub

&lt;%# DoSomethingWithDataStronglyTyped (Container.DataItem) %&gt;

Sub DoSomethingWithDataStronglyTyped (Object data)
   Dim StronglyTyped as SomeType
   StronglyTyped = DirectCast (data, SomeType)
   DoSomethingWithDataStronglyTyped = DoSomethingElse(StronglyTyped)
End Sub

Sub ExampleOfDataBinderEvalReuse ()

   Dim StronglyTyped as SomeType
   StronglyTyped = GetSomeData()

   ' get "Foo" property of the SomeType class
   DataBinder.Eval(StronglyTyped, "Foo")
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I have a form that is being filled by customers, the form is very long and contains approximately 30-40 fields.</p>

<p>One part of the form is particularly complex to store as it is a matrix of checkboxes that the user needs to select.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; Fir Item | A Checkbox | B Checkbox | C Checkbox
&gt; Sec Item | A Checkbox | B Checkbox | C Checkbox
&gt; Thi Item | A Checkbox | B Checkbox | C Checkbox
&gt; Fou Item | A Checkbox | B Checkbox | C Checkbox
&gt; Fif Item | A Checkbox | B Checkbox | C Checkbox
</code></pre>

<p>What is the most efficient way of storing this data?</p>

<pre><code>mysql -uroot 
</code></pre>

<p>i get this</p>

<pre><code>-bash: mysql: command not found
</code></pre>

<p>what am i doing wrong</p>

<p>You need to make sure your user id is part of the params passed to Group.new, perhaps something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def create
  @group = Group.new(params[:group].merge!({:user_id =&gt; current_user}))
  if @group.save
    flash[:notice] = "Successfully created group."
    redirect_to groups_url
  else
    render :action =&gt; 'new'
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to add a flash[:error] in your else clause as well otherwise it would be confusing to the user to end up on the new action with no explanation.</p>

<p>I am planing to do the Spring web application developer..so may i know what are the prerequisite for this exam? can i directly purchase a voucher and do..i saw in web for prerequisite it stated "Rich Web Training from SpringSource or Certified Partner"..any idea of that traning? is it mandotry? i saw its schedule in many countries but not mine also i saw an online classes too for it..but what about the price..? i hope to study the ebook spring in action..and do the exam.. </p>

<p>Hi there, I guess this has been already answered. However, I think that you can still mix both options in a syntactically better way by doing:</p>

<pre><code>Switch (value)
{
case 1: case 2: case 3:          
    // Do Something
    break;
case 4: case 5: case 6: 
    // Do Something
    break;
default:
    // Do Something
    break;
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>$content</code> gives the html code like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img ... /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="video"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or just </p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more text&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also we have a variable:</p>

<pre><code>$video_match = false;
</code></pre>

<p>We should turn <code>$video_match</code> to <code>true</code>, if <code>&lt;div class="video"&gt;</code> (exactly this code) exists in <code>$content</code>.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am a noob when it comes to json. The more I use it, I am starting to like it. I have a output that looks like this</p>

<pre><code>[
    {
        "product": {
            "id": "6",
            "category": "Books",
            "created": "2010-04-13 15:15:18",
        },
        "availability": [
            {
                "country": "United Kingdom",
                "price": "$13.99",
            },
            {
                "country": "Germany",
                "price": "$13.99",
            }
        ]            
    }
]
</code></pre>

<p>Actually I have listed only one product, But output has many products listed. I want to loop through this json output and get all the product's category, countries where they are available and price using fbjs.</p>

<p>I appreciate any help.</p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>You can call <em>infowindow.setContent</em> at any point after the info window has been shown.  So you could initially set your info window content with a spinner, make the AJAX call (from the event handler) and then call <em>infowindow.setContent</em> again from the AJAX response with the appropriate data.</p>

<p>While monads are represented in Haskell using the bind and return functions, they can also have another representation using the join function, such as <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Category_theory#Monads" rel="nofollow">discussed here</a>. I know the type of this function is M(M(X))->M(X), but what does this actually do?</p>

<p>I tend to use <code>struct</code> a lot.</p>

<p>For the "traditional" OOP classes (the ones that represent a specific "thing"), I tend to use <code>class</code> simply because it's a common convention.</p>

<p>But most of my classes aren't really OOP objects. They tend to be functors, and traits classes and all sorts of other more abstract code concepts, things I <em>use to express myself</em>, rather than modelling specific "things". And those I usually make <code>struct</code>. It saves me having to type the initial <code>public:</code>, and so it makes the class definition shorter and easier to get an overview of.</p>

<p>I also lean towards making larger, more complex classes <code>class</code>. Except this rarely affects anything, because I lean even more towards refactoring large, complex classes... And then I'm left with small simple ones, which might be made <code>struct</code>'s.</p>

<p>But in either case, I'd never consider it "evil". "Evil" is when you do something that actively obfuscates your code, or when you make something far more complex than necessary.</p>

<p>But every C++ programmer knows that <code>struct</code> and <code>class</code> mean virtually the same thing. You're not going to be confused for long because you see a <code>struct Animal {...};</code> You know that it's a class designed to model an animal. So no, it's not "evil" no matter which way you do it.</p>

<p>Use:</p>

<pre><code>if (strpos($content, '&lt;div class="video"&gt;') !== FALSE)

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have a client that registers with JMX for notifications.
Whenever that JMX Notifications Emitting application is restarted I get an exception</p>

<pre><code>01/08/2010 16:28:04 com.sun.jmx.remote.ws.client.JMXWSManStub fetchNotifications
WARNING: Exception java.io.IOException: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connectoccured during fetch. Closing connection
</code></pre>

<p>And stop getting notifications (Obviously).</p>

<p>I would like to be able to catch this exception so I can start a thread that will poll on the target application until it's back up and then I would like to re-register with the events.</p>

<p>My question is - How can I handle this exception myself? Currently the JMX Platform catches it and I'm not sure If I can take over handling it myself.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

[Option]   (Id, Name)
[CustomerResponse] (CustomerId, ItemId, OptionId)
</code></pre>

<p>If options "never" changes and you don't want to keep them in a separate table:</p>

<pre><code>[Customer] (Id, ....)
[Item]     (Id, Name)
[CustomerResponse] (CustomerId, ItemId, OptionA bit, OptionB bit, OptionC bit)
</code></pre>

<p>What is the output of the following command in the shell:</p>

<pre><code>ls /usr/local/mysql/bin

<p>?</p>

<p>I needed to do this for a project recently and ended up with an extension to DOMElement: <a href="http://www.keyvan.net/2010/07/javascript-like-innerhtml-access-in-php/" rel="nofollow">http://www.keyvan.net/2010/07/javascript-like-innerhtml-access-in-php/</a></p>

<p>Here's an example showing how it's used:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
require_once 'JSLikeHTMLElement.php';
$doc = new DOMDocument();
$doc-&gt;registerNodeClass('DOMElement', 'JSLikeHTMLElement');
$doc-&gt;loadHTML('&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Para 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Para 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');
$elem = $doc-&gt;getElementsByTagName('div')-&gt;item(0);

// print innerHTML
echo $elem-&gt;innerHTML; // prints '&lt;p&gt;Para 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Para 2&lt;/p&gt;'

// set innerHTML
$elem-&gt;innerHTML = '&lt;a href="http://fivefilters.org"&gt;FF&lt;/a&gt;';

// print document (with our changes)
echo $doc-&gt;saveXML();

<p>I'm not sure about OpenCVDotNet.. but as far as I remember OpenCV (the old C/C++ lib) used to have some sosrt of integration with FFMPEG</p>

<p><a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/FFMPEG" rel="nofollow">http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/FFMPEG</a></p>

<p>Here is how you can do it with a recursive function (the code is in Java):</p>

<pre><code>void doOperation(List&lt;Integer&gt; list, int prefix, int minimum, int maximum) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 9; i++) {
        int newNumber = prefix * 10 + i;
        if (newNumber &gt;= minimum &amp;&amp; newNumber &lt;= maximum) {
            list.add(newNumber);
        }
        if (newNumber &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; newNumber &lt;= maximum) {
            doOperation(list, newNumber, minimum, maximum);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; numberList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
int min=1, max =100;
doOperation(numberList, 0, min, max);
System.out.println(numberList.toString());
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I translated my code in C++ <a href="http://ideone.com/o48Ux" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 

void doOperation(int list[], int &amp;index, int prefix, int minimum, int maximum) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 9; i++) {
        int newNumber = prefix * 10 + i;
        if (newNumber &gt;= minimum &amp;&amp; newNumber &lt;= maximum) {
            list[index++] = newNumber;
        }
        if (newNumber &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; newNumber &lt;= maximum) {
            doOperation(list, index, newNumber, minimum, maximum);
        }
    }
}

int main(void) { 
        int min=1, max =100;
        int* numberList = new int[max-min+1];
        int index = 0;
        doOperation(numberList, index, 0, min, max);
        printf("["); 
        for(int i=0; i&lt;max-min+1; i++) {
                printf("%d ", numberList[i]); 
        }
        printf("]"); 
        return 0; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the idea is: for each digit (0-9), I add it to the array if it is between <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code>. Then, I call the same function with this digit as prefix. It does the same: for each digit, it adds it to the prefix (<code>prefix * 10 + i</code>) and if it is between the limits, it adds it to the array. It stops when <code>newNumber</code> is greater than maximum.</p>

<p>The comment form is controlled by the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/comment_form" rel="nofollow"><code>comment_form()</code> function</a>.  You have 2 options if you want to change it's output:</p>

<ol>
<li>Change the <code>$fields</code> argument when you call it to remove the <code>comment_author_url</code>.</li>
<li>Filter the output of the function in your theme's <code>functions.php</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Fields argument</strong></p>

<pre><code>$your_fields =  array(
    'author' =&gt; '&lt;p class="comment-form-author"&gt;' . '&lt;label for="author"&gt;' . __( 'Name' ) . '&lt;/label&gt; ' . ( $req ? '&lt;span class="required"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;' : '' ) .               '&lt;input id="author" name="author" type="text" value="' . esc_attr( $commenter['comment_author'] ) . '" size="30"' . $aria_req . ' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;',
    'email'  =&gt; '&lt;p class="comment-form-email"&gt;&lt;label for="email"&gt;' . __( 'Email' ) . '&lt;/label&gt; ' . ( $req ? '&lt;span class="required"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;' : '' ) . '&lt;input id="email" name="email" type="text" value="' . esc_attr(  $commenter['comment_author_email'] ) . '" size="30"' . $aria_req . ' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;',
);
comment_form(array('fields' =&gt; $your_fields));
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Filter</strong></p>

<pre><code>function your_comment_form_fields($the_form_fields){
    // code to remove the author field from $the_form_fields
    return $the_form_fields;
}
add_filter('comment_form_default_fields', 'your_comment_form_fields');

<p>hello guys,
i got this code that keep on returning undefined msg instead of the expected html.
<strong>Purpose of function:</strong>
the purpose of the below function is to return notifications in away similar to fb one's. the code is working fine. but there's something wrong with the getJSON part that i couldn't figure out. so instead of returning "clonex1 likes your post" i get undefined.
<strong>the code</strong></p>

<p>thanks</p>

<p>First you'll want to make sure that a group can't be saved without a user:</p>

<p><strong>/app/models/group.rb</strong></p>

<pre><code>class Group
  belongs_to :user
  validates_presence_of :user
end
</code></pre>

<p>Then, lets default the group to be the current user.</p>

<p><strong>/app/controllers/groups_controller.rb</strong></p>

<pre><code>def create
  @group = Group.new(params[:group])
  @group.user = current.user
  if @group.save
    ...
  else
    ...
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>You could also do a <code>@group.user = current_user if @group.user.nil?</code> but it sounds like the only person to create a group will be the current user.</p>

<p>You need to give the __cyg* functions "C" linkage. A function defined in C++ normally gets a mangled name which can't be used from libraries not written in C++. You can ask the compiler to give a function the name C would give it by using an `extern "C"{} block. The following should compile fine.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

extern "C" {
  void __cyg_profile_func_enter( void *, void * ) __attribute__ ((no_instrument_function));

  void __cyg_profile_func_enter(void *func, void *callsite)
  {
    printf("enter %p\n", func);
  }
  void __cyg_profile_func_exit( void *, void * ) __attribute__ ((no_instrument_function));

  void __cyg_profile_func_exit(void *func, void *callsite)
  {
    printf("exit %p\n", func);
  }

}
  void func_c( void )
  {
    return;
  }

  void func_b( void )
  {
    func_c();

    return;
  }

  void func_a( void )
  {
    func_b();
    return;
  }


  int main()
  {
    func_a();
    func_c();
  }

<p><strong>Const accessors are faster</strong></p>

<p>It depends, but usually no</p>

<p>I am monkey-patching some of the jQuery's Draggable code*</p>

<p>The goal is to avoid modifying the original source files and patch dynamically one of the internal functions.</p>

<p>The function <strong>_generatePosition</strong> is declared like this:</p>

<pre><code>(function($) {

    $.widget("ui.draggable", $.ui.mouse, {
        ...
        _generatePosition: function(event) {
            ...
        }
    }
})(jQuery);
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to achieve the dynamic replacement of it?</p>

<hr>

<p>*so it calculates the snapping grid relative to the top of parent element and not relative to the top of element being dragged. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3036240/jquerys-draggable-grid">here</a> for more details</p>

<p>Since I don't know exactly what part of it alone that triggers the error, I'm not entirely sure how to better label it.</p>

<p>This question is a by-product of the SO question <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3379894/c-code-seems-to-get-optimized-in-an-invalid-way-such-that-an-object-value-become">c# code seems to get optimized in an invalid way such that an object value becomes null</a>, which I attempted to help <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/301903/gary">Gary</a> with yesterday evening. He was the one that found out that there was a problem, I've just reduced the problem to a simpler project, and want verification before I go further with it, hence this question here.</p>

<p>I'll post a note on Microsoft Connect if others can verify that they too get this problem, and of course I hope that either Jon, Mads or Eric will take a look at it as well :)</p>

<p>It involves:</p>

<ul>
<li>3 projects, 2 of which are class libraries, one of which is a console program (this last one isn't needed to reproduce the problem, but just executing this shows the problem, whereas you need to use reflector and look at the compiled code if you don't add it)</li>
<li>Incomplete references and type inference</li>
<li>Generics</li>
</ul>

<p>The code is available here: <a href="http://hg.vkarlsen.no/hgweb.cgi/StackOverflow/file/tip/SO3379894" rel="nofollow">code repository</a>.</p>

<p>I'll post a description below of how to make the projects if you rather want to get your hands dirty.</p>

<p>The problem exhibits itself by producing an invalid cast in a method call, before returning a simple generic list, casting it to something strange before returning it. The original code ended up with a cast to a boolean, yes, a boolean. The compiler added a cast from a <code>List&lt;SomeEntityObject&gt;</code> to a boolean, before returning the result, and the method signature said that it would return a <code>List&lt;SomeEntityObject&gt;</code>. This in turn leads to odd problems at runtime, everything from the result of the method call being considered "optimized away" (the original question), or a crash with either <code>BadImageFormatException</code> or <code>InvalidProgramException</code> or one of the similar exceptions.</p>

<p>During my work to reproduce this, I've seen a cast to <code>void[]</code>, and the current version of my code now casts to a <code>TypedReference</code>. In one case, Reflector crashes so most likely the code was beyond hope in that case. Your mileage might vary.</p>

<p>Here's what to do to reproduce it:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is likely that there are more minimal forms that will reproduce the problem, but moving all the code to just one project made it go away. Removing the generics from the classes also makes the problem go away. The code below reproduces the problem each time for me, so I'm leaving it as is.</p>

<p><strong>I apologize for the escaped html characters in the code below, this is Markdown playing a trick on me, if anyone knows how I can rectify it, please let me know, or just edit the question</strong></p>

            // This will crash with InvalidProgramException
            // or BadImageFormatException, or a similar exception
            List&lt;Dummy&gt; dummies = dummy.GetDummies();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Build, and ensure there are no compiler errors</p></li>
<li>Now try running the program. This should crash with one of the more horrible exceptions. I've seen both InvalidProgramException and BadImageFormatException, depending on what the cast ended up as</li>
<li><p>Look at the generated code of Dummy.GetDummies in Reflector. The source code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;Dummy&gt; GetDummies()
{
    var policy = Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy();
    return new List&lt;Dummy&gt;();
}
</code></pre>

<p>however reflector says (for me, it might differ in which cast it chose for you, and in one case Reflector even crashed):</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;Dummy&gt; GetDummies()
{
    List&lt;Dummy&gt; policy = (List&lt;Dummy&gt;)this.Cache.GetDefaultCacheItemPolicy();
    TypedReference CS$1$0000 = (TypedReference) new List&lt;Dummy&gt;();
    return (List&lt;Dummy&gt;) CS$1$0000;
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, here's a couple of odd things, the above crash/invalid code aside:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Library2, which has <code>Dummy.GetDummies</code>, performs a call to get the default cache policy on the class from Library1. It uses type inference <code>var policy = ...</code>, and the result is an <code>CacheItemPolicy</code> object (null in the code, but type is important).</p>

<p>However, ClassLibrary2 does not have a reference to System.Runtime.Caching, so it should not compile.</p>

<p>And indeed, if you comment out the method in Dummy that is named <code>TryCommentingMeOut</code>, you get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type 'System.Runtime.Caching.CacheItemPolicy' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'System.Runtime.Caching, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why having this method present makes the compiler happy I don't know, and I don't even know if this is linked to the current problem or not. Perhaps it is a second bug.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a similar method in <code>DummyCache</code>, if you restore the method in <code>Dummy</code>, so that the code again compiles, and then comment out the method in <code>DummyCache</code> that has the "Try commenting this out" comment above it, you get the same compiler error</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hi,
I apply impulse in an object in box2d iPhone app and now want to increase its speed in particuler direction....i mean i need two thing</p>

<p>1.through the object in a direction
2.increase speed</p>

<p>plz help..</p>

<p>There is a way to do this but its a bit brutal.
Go to the directory where your projects are located. Usually somewhere in your My Documents. And go to the directory of the project you want all the Data services from.</p>

<p>Find the ".model" directory and there you will find your "~project name~.fml" file. Now open a text editor and open that file. Copy past it in memory.</p>

<p>Make a new project.
Then go to the new project folder, also to its ".model" folder and open the "~project name~.fml" file there. Delete what is inside and paste all that is in memory inside that file.</p>

<p>Don't forget to copy paste the valueObjects folder and the services folder from the old project.
Within the new project you can then delete a service if you don't want to use it and from there on start your new project.</p>

<p>Hope this will help, and I hope Adobe will create a true import / export for this.</p>

<p>This string:</p>

<pre><code>"CREATE USER %s PASSWORD %s", (user, pw)
</code></pre>

<p>always gets expanded to:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE USER E'someuser' PASSWORD E'somepassword'
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone tell me why?</p>

<p>Edit:
The expanded string above is the string my database gives me back in the error message. I'm using psycopg2 to access my postgres database. The real code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>conn=psycopg2.connect(user=adminuser, password=adminpass, host=host)
cur = conn.cursor()

#user and pw are simple standard python strings the function gets as parameter
cur.execute("CREATE USER %s PASSWORD %s", (user, pw))
conn.commit()
</code></pre>

<p>As of today, my approach towards this (is heavily biased on the GOOS book that I just read, but it's the best that I know of today):</p>

<ul>
<li>Create an interface to abstract away the file system from your code. Mock it where this class is needed as a collaborator/dependency. This keeps your unit-tests quick and feedback fast.</li>
<li>Create integration tests that test the actual implementation of the interface. i.e. verify that calling Save() actually persists a file to disk and has the write contents (use a reference file or parse it for a few things that it should contain)</li>
<li>Create an acceptance test that tests the whole system - end to end. Here you may just verify that a file is created - the intent of this test is to confirm if the real implementation is wired / plugged in correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>HTH</p>

<p>Step 1: Set the PATH</p>

<p>Did you do that (including the "source ~/.profile" bit)? Your shell cannot find the mysql command. So, you have either not installed it at all or installed in a location not listed in your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>You can run a spotlight query from the command line to find all occurances of the mysql command like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ mdfind mysql | grep '/mysql$'
</code></pre>

<p>I need a book like "Core Java" (both volumes) but written in a more serious style. I'm not a newbie, but not looking for a guru guide. I read Volume 1 a while ago and it was a disappointment. I need something more middle level and not just TWO volumes of pointless newspaper talk.
The faults about "Core Java" are countless (my opinion), but the fact is that there is no strict and tight structure - it's a book written to make a lot of pages. Another thing is that I can't sense a good Linux understanding : even the installation is made "the bad way" - no package manager use is suggested !</p>

<p>I don't need "Thinking in Java" and "Effective Java" since they are next on the list and are not about "what", but about "how" .</p>

<p>As for the reason, to deny you access isn't the reason really (not in this case).  In library cases like this it's more to be clean than deny you access, <em>or</em> because the library may want to change architecture later, and still break as few people as possible when they do so...letting you only access the "public" members of their code gives the authors more flexibility in changing anything that's "private".</p>

<p>Case in point: jQuery UI 1.8 moved a lot of code into the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/" rel="nofollow">position utility</a>, allowing a lot of private code cleanup that you didn't see happen, since it was all private before this allowed a fairly big optimization/code reduction without breaking people left and right.</p>

<p>In my opinion, "memoization" is highly overrated. There is no
one-size-fits-all memoization technique (in any programming
language) that turns every single-case calculation into a
general calculation. You have to understand each problem,
and organize things to control the amount of memory you need
to use.</p>

<p>In this case, to get the number of paths for an <code>n x m</code> rectangle,
you don't need to remember the totals for <em>all</em> smaller rectangles,
just for the rectangles that are one step smaller in either direction.
So you can build up row by row, forgetting all of the totals for
smaller rectangles as you go.</p>

<p>In Haskell, laziness is perfect for this kind of situation. It relieves
you of all the work of keeping of track of exactly what to remember
and what to forget - just compute an infinite grid of the totals for
all possible rectangles, and let Haskell do the rest of the work.</p>

<p>For zero rows, you have only the bottom line. No matter how long it is,
there is only a single path to the end, so the numbers of paths are
<code>repeat 1</code>.</p>

<p>To compute a row in the grid from the previous row, you start with <code>1</code>
(only one path straight down, no matter how high you are),
then at each step you add together the corresponding entry in the
previous row and the previous step in the current row. Altogether, we have:</p>

<pre><code>iterate (scanl (+) 1 . tail) (repeat 1) !! 20 !! 20
</code></pre>

<p>That computes the answer instantaneously for me at the GHCi prompt.</p>

<p>Sounds like a question best asked on <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com">http://gis.stackexchange.com</a></p>

<p>It turns I can simply do the following:</p>

<pre><code>Function GetSomeMoreXml() As XElement
   Return &lt;moreXml/&gt;
End Function

Sub Main()
   Dim myXml = &lt;myXml&gt;
                  &lt;%= GetSomeMoreXml() %&gt;
               &lt;/myXml&gt;
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>Which is pretty neat. It allows me to break up my XML literals into more manageable chunks.</p>

<p>How about using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq.enumerable.join.aspx" rel="nofollow">Enumerable.Join</a>?</p>

<pre><code>var list = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var list2 = new List&lt;string&gt; { "2", "4", "5" };

var matches = from i in list
              join s in list2 on i.ToString() equals s
              select i; // if you want to use the matching items from the 1st list

// there's no ForEach on Enumerable so you'd have to write the extension yourself (which is easy)
// or you could just output matches to a List first
matches.ToList().ForEach(i =&gt; Console.WriteLine(i));
</code></pre>

<p>When it comes to joins I strongly prefer the linq query syntax, though you could equally use Lambda expression they usually look a bit messy... </p>

<pre><code>git rm -r .
git checkout HEAD~3 .
git commit
</code></pre>

<p>After the commit, files in the new <code>HEAD</code> will be the same as they were in the revision <code>HEAD~3</code>.</p>

<p>The function <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.fputcsv.php" rel="nofollow">fputcsv</a> can do the job.</p>

<p>You may have a look at the book by Khalid Mughal which is targeted specifically for SCJP exams.

I would also recommend "<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/effective/" rel="nofollow">Effective Java</a>"</p>

<p>From the same page we recover this information <code>join x = x &gt;&gt;= id</code>, with knowledge of how the <code>bind</code> and <code>id</code> functions work you should be able to figure out what <code>join</code> does.</p>

<pre><code>             trans_dBindingSource.EndEdit();

            if (stock_dataset.trans_d.GetChanges(DataRowState.Added) != null)
            {
                saveToolStripButton.PerformClick();
            }
            if (stock_dataset.trans_d.GetChanges(DataRowState.Modified) != null)
            {
                saveToolStripButton.PerformClick();
            }
            if (stock_dataset.trans_d.GetChanges(DataRowState.Unchanged) != null)
            {
                return;
            }
</code></pre>

<p>If you do not want to convert them to strings, but have enough space to store an extra copy of the list I would store the largest power of ten less than the element in the copy.  This is probably easiest to do with a loop.  Now call your original array <code>x</code> and the powers of ten <code>y</code>. </p>

<pre><code>int findPower(int x) {
   int y = 1;
   while (y * 10 &lt; x) {
      y = y * 10;
   }
   return y;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could also compute them directly </p>

<pre><code>y = exp10(floor(log10(x)));
</code></pre>

<p>but I suspect that the iteration may be faster than the conversions to and from floating point.</p>

<p>In order to compare the <code>i</code>th and <code>j</code>th elements</p>

<pre><code>bool compare(int i, int j) {
  if (y[i] &lt; y[j]) {
    int ti = x[i] * (y[j] / y[i]);
    if (ti == x[j]) {
      return (y[i] &lt; y[j]);  // the compiler will optimize this
    } else {
      return (ti &lt; x[j]);
    }
  } else if (y[i] &gt; y[j]) {
    int tj = x[j] * (y[i] / y[j]);
    if (x[i] == tj) {
      return (y[i] &lt; y[j]);  // the compiler will optimize this
    } else {
      return (x[i] &lt; tj);
    }
  } else {
     return (x[i] &lt; x[j];
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>What is being done here is we are multiplying the smaller number by the appropriate power of ten to make the two numbers have an equal number of digits, then comparing them.  if the two modified numbers are equal, then compare the digit lengths.</p>

<p>If you do not have the space to store the y arrays you can compute them on each comparison.</p>

<p>In general, you are likely better off using the preoptimized digit conversion routines.</p>

<p>Ensure that the <code>name</code> parameter do not contain one or more slashes: <code>/</code>
The parameter can not be parsed correctly to put into the init function.</p>

<p>I am a complete novice to iPhone/iPad development, but I have OOP experience in other languages.  I apologize in advance if this question is rather vague.</p>

<p>What I really want to know is this:</p>

<p>My app idea needs to work in a single view where the view is a scrollable area that is a fixed height (bigger than the viewport).  Various different events can happen within this scrollable area.  The app will have an immersive feel to it (quite texture/image intensive), but it is not a 'game' as such (think scrollable bookshelf).</p>

<p>Which apple project would be a good way to start this? View-based? OpenGL ES?
How easy is it to make a fixed scrollable area?</p>

<p>Quite possibly what you are seeing is not your activity, but the Browser application, because the URL you linked to did a redirect. Use <code>WebViewClient</code> and <code>shouldOverrideUrlLoading()</code> to catch the redirect and send it back to your own <code>WebView</code>.</p>

<p>Not only the E but the quotes appear to come from whatever type user and pw have. %s simply does what str() does, which may fall back to repr(), both of which have corresponding methods <code>__str__</code> and <code>__repr__</code>. Also, that isn't the code that generates your result (I'd assumed there was a %, but now see only a comma). Please expand your question with actual code, types and values.</p>

<p>Addendum: Considering that it looks like SQL, I'd hazard a guess that you're seeing <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/935/string-literals-and-escape-characters-in-postgresql">escape string constants</a>, likely properly generated by your database interface module or library.</p>

<p>The BASE acronym was defined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Brewer_%28scientist%29" rel="nofollow">Eric Brewer</a>, who is also known for formulating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem" rel="nofollow">CAP theorem</a>.</p>

<p>The CAP theorem states that a distributed computer system cannot guarantee all of the following three properties at the same time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Availability</li>
<li>Partition tolerance</li>
</ul>

<p>A BASE system gives up on consistency.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Basically available</strong> indicates that the system <em>does</em> guarantee availability, in terms of the CAP theorem.</li>
<li><strong>Soft state</strong> indicates that the state of the system may change over time, even without input. This is because of the eventual consistency model.</li>
<li><strong>Eventual consistency</strong> indicates that the system will become consistent over time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Brewer does admit that <a href="http://www.julianbrowne.com/article/viewer/brewers-cap-theorem" rel="nofollow">the acronym is contrived</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I came up with [the BASE] acronym with my students in their office earlier that year. I agree it is contrived a bit, but so is "ACID" -- much more than people realize, so we figured it was good enough.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have a few arrays of the same length. I want to sort the first array, and make all the others array "sort" accordingly. For example, if the first array is <code>(7,2,9)</code> the second is <code>("seven","two","nine")</code> and the third is <code>("VII","II","IX")</code> after the sort (ascendingly according to the first array values) we will have <code>(2,7,9)</code> <code>("two","seven","nine")</code> and <code>("II","VII","IX")</code>.</p>

<p>How can I do that?</p>

<p>I have a Qt app which embeds a Flash Player ActiveX control. I put a button over the flashplayer and I need to set some parts of it transparent. Since the AX control is not part of the Qt rendering pipe, it's needed to fake the transparency. For this purpose I grab the contents of the AX control from under the button, and use it when rendering the button:</p>

<pre><code>QRect wrect = btn.geometry();
QPixmap bgpart = QPixmap::grabWidget(player, wrect);
btn.setBackground(bgpart);
</code></pre>

<p><code>btn</code> is an instance of a custom QPushButton class which uses the background pixmap.</p>

<p>The problem is that it only grabs the screenshot for the very first time after running the app. If the contents of the player change and I call grabWidget again, bgpart will have hold the same pixmap it obtained before.</p>

<p>What should I do to get this correctly?</p>

<p>Hi stackoverflow community, I have an HTML, XML, JS related problem...</p>

<p>Im learning a bit of web programming languages and as a project I started making a JS-based browser game. On an earlier project, I had some trouble when I wanted to save the Highscores to a MySQL database (from JS variable to php variable). In the end, I found a way to avoid this by placing the scores in a hidden div, and by using HTML DOM placing the score in a form (JS -> PHP -> MySQL).</p>

<p>Now, on this project, I started using this technique to avoid a lot of JS-scripting, and using the hidden div as a sort of temporary memory. But it turned out to be some very messy code so I wanted to try using XML for putting temporary data away. I checked out the W3-schools site and adapted my code.</p>

<p>The game is a sort of turn-price game (very simple), where each 'day' prices get renewed and you make money by selling stuff you bought a day earlier at a cheaper price. I wanted to save the prices of the day earlier, to make a 'Your profit is: $ .....' menu. So, I thought putting the data in an XML file, so I could easily save the data and recall it later.</p>

<p>Now the problem is, that the data doesn't get saved at all. When I leave a JS-function, the XML-file is 'reset', all the data is lost... How can I save the XML file on the server?</p>

<p>Just to make things clear, I added my code, but I know it is very messy (first time I use XML :)... So I added some comments, I hope it helps. To make the problem concrete: when the nextDay() function fires, it should save the prices from the previous day, and then renew the prices, but they don't get saved.</p>

<p>Hi i am making a school information software. Is there any third party reliable library that can be used for calculating grades of students referring marks for the same from specified database.It should be flexible enough to let client specify criteria for grade calculation in terms of standard deviation, median etc.</p>

<p>I found the same annoying bug and developed a workaround with a further div and a bit of CSS. Assign the streetView to #street</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="map" style="width:500px;height:300px;display:block"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="street" style="width:500px;height:300px;display:none"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Add a function to toggle the visibility of the divs:</p>

<pre><code>function toggleStreetView() {
  var mapDiv    = document.getElementById('map');
  var streetDiv = document.getElementById('street');

  var streetVisible = (streetDiv.style.display == 'block');
  if (streetVisible) {
    // hide streetView, show map
    streetDiv.display = 'none';
    mapDiv.display    = 'block';
  } else {
    // vice versa
    mapDiv.display    = 'none';
    streetDiv.display = 'block';
    streetView.setVisible(true); /* order important, show after div is visible */
  }      
}
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe not the most elegant solution - but it works. With CSS absolute positioning and a JavaScript framework, i prefer jQuery, you can add a nice fade effect.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>There's probably something really obvious I'm missing, but no matter how I trawl the documentation &amp; the blogs, I can't find a way to make a button report whether or not it is being touched, regardless of whether the touch moves, etc. I have an up  &amp; down button, &amp; I need to call the relevant method whenever there is a finger on it.</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>

<p>Franklyn Weber</p>

<p>You can easily do this using a base class or a component mapping. I would not use extension methods for this purpose. I use a base class:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Auditable : IAuditable
{
    public virtual string CreatedBy { get; set; }
    public virtual DateTime CreatedDate { get; set; }
}

public class Person : Auditable {}
</code></pre>

<p>Fluent mapping:</p>

<pre><code>public class AuditableClassMap&lt;T&gt; : ClassMap&lt;T&gt; where T: IAuditable
{
    public AuditableClassMap()
    {
        Map(x =&gt; x.CreatedBy);
        Map(x =&gt; x.CreatedDate);
    }
}

public class PersonMap : AuditableClassMap&lt;Person&gt; {}
</code></pre>

<p>If you are adamant about keeping audit properties out of your classes you could map the audit properties as a component.</p>

<p>It depends on how you define “equivalent.” The C character classes are quite simple minded compared to Unicode character classes. For example, if you want to test whether a given code point usually represents a letter (for some definition of “letter”), you could test for the general category <code>L</code>; if you want to check whether a given string comprises a valid identifier, you could use <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/" rel="nofollow">UAX #31</a>, etc. <code>iswalnum</code> and <code>iswalpha</code> might give the intended result depending on the current “locale” setting.</p>

<p>Dear,
obj_mc.visible = false; not working on mac, work good on pc.</p>

<p>AIR \ AS3</p>

<p>I'm getting</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.NotSupportedException: All
  objects in the EntitySet
  'Entities.Message' must have unique
  primary keys. However, an instance of
  type 'Model.Message' and an instance
  of type 'Model.Comment' both have the
  same primary key value</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but I have no idea what this means.</p>

<p>Using EF4, I have a bunch of entities of type Message. Some of these messages are actually a subtype, Comment, inheritance by table-per-type. Just </p>

<pre><code> DB.Message.First();
</code></pre>

<p>will produce the exception. I have other instances of subtyping where I don't experience problems but I can't see any discrepencies. Sometimes, though, the problem goes away if I restart the development server, but not always.</p>

<p>Edit:
I've worked out (should have before) that the problem is a fault of the stored procedure fetching my Messages. The way this is currently set up as that all the fields pertaining to Message is fetched, the Comment table is ignored by the sproc. The context then proceeds to muck this up, probably by fetching those Messages that are also Comments again, as you suggested. How to do this properly is the central issue at hand. I've found some indications to a solution at <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/adodotnetentityframework/thread/bb0bb421-ba8e-4b35-b7a7-950901adb602" rel="nofollow">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/adodotnetentityframework/thread/bb0bb421-ba8e-4b35-b7a7-950901adb602</a>.</p>

<p>They do not. They're just an antenna hooked to a data-providing chip, powered by the external radio waves of a reader.</p>

<p>When you append the content to the end of your "curl" variable like you are, you are attempting to add it to be retrieved through a <code>GET</code> variable and will get a result in a request like <code>http://localhost:8080/test/grab/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask</code>. Clearly this is an invalid request. Your <code>GET</code> variable parsing is not going to be consistent and a dangerous way of passing data back to your controller (especially if users will be able to edit the appended value).</p>

<p>Instead, you should use the <code>data</code> attribute in jQuery to pass this information back in your POST request as described in the instructions here: <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/</a></p>

<p>On the Cake side, you'll be able to receive this value as <code>$this-&gt;data['IDValueYouConfigured']</code>. For example, if your AJAX request was like:</p>

<pre><code>  var whatContent=$("#testing").val();
  var curl="http://localhost:8080/test/grab/";
  $.ajax({
  type: "POST",
  url: curl,
  data: "formValue="+whatContent,   
  success: function(data) {    
  alert(data);}
  });
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>formValue</code> is the <code>IDValueYouConfigured</code> that I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>More importantly, you seem to be misunderstanding proper use of the Cake framework and could be performing all of these functions MUCH more simply using things like the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/view/1592/Js" rel="nofollow">JsHelper</a>, <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/view/1383/Form" rel="nofollow">FormHelper</a>, etc. I would recommend using the most RECENT version of <a href="http://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/downloads" rel="nofollow">Cake (1.3.3)</a> and follow through the <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/view/1528/Blog" rel="nofollow">Blog tutorial</a> at least once. This will lead to <a href="http://www.gerv.net/hacking/how-to-ask-good-questions/" rel="nofollow">better questions</a> which will be more likely to get helpful answers. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Query looks correct. Manually breakdown and see how many rows are preset for </p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM reservation WHERE room = 100 AND dateStarted &gt; '2010-08-12'</code></p>

<p>and </p>

<p><code>SELECT * FROM reservation WHERE room = 100 AND dateEnded &lt; '2010-08-14'</code></p>

<p>Most probably there is no record satisfying your query. </p>

<p>And assuming that there are more records in your database other then one mentioned by you.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add quartzCore as a framework</li>
<li>Add an import QuartzCore/QuartzCore.h</li>
<li><p>Use this code</p>

<p>I'm using vhochstein's fork of active_scaffold, which runs quite nicely on rails 3, except for a few small bugs - <a href="http://github.com/vhochstein/active_scaffold" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/vhochstein/active_scaffold</a>.</p>

<p>In rails 2.3, the following code disables a link:</p>

<pre><code>return "&lt;a class='disabled'&gt;#{text}&lt;/a&gt;" unless authorized
</code></pre>

<p>But in Rails 3, it causes the escaped html tags to be printed out instead as in the following photo:</p>

<p><img src="http://internet-websites.s3.amazonaws.com/image2886.png" width="475" height="317" alt="http://internet-websites.s3.amazonaws.com/image2886.png"></p>

<p>How can I make the content of this return statement render the way it should in rails 3?  </p>

<p>The code above, is from the <code>list_column_helpers.rb</code> file in vendor/plugins/active_scaffold/helpers/</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Floatless fixed this by suggesting to add <code>.html_safe</code> to the code.  </p>

<p>I have since found that the folowing change also needs to be made as there's more than one bit of code that is respondible for disabling action links in active_Scaffold:</p>

<p>In /plugins/active_scaffold/frontends/default/views/_list_actions.html.erb change:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= record.authorized_for?(:crud_type =&gt; etc etc etc -%&gt;

By making it use "raw"

i.e. 

&lt;%= raw record.authorized_for?(:crud_type =&gt; etc etc etc -%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, thanks to floatless and hopefully mr hochstein will be able to use this stuff.</p>

<p>I'll need to develop a Java service that is simple because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It only communicates via a TCP socket, no HTTP.</li>
<li>It runs on a dedicated server (there are no other services except the basic SSH and such)</li>
</ul>

<p>Should I make this a standalone service (maybe in something like Java Service Wrapper) or make it run in a container like Tomcat? What are the benefits and detriments of both?         </p>

<p>I'm used to dynamic typing meaning checking for type info of object/non object oriented structure at runtime and throwing some sort of type error, ie if it quacks like a duck its a duck. Is there a different type of dynamic typing (please go into details).</p>

<p>Well<br>
this is a really simple question, the search tearms are just not that great.</p>

<p>How do I check in some library if I am currently running as a console application, vs. a WPF window application?</p>

<p>Thanks for any tips,</p>

<p>Chris</p>

<p>In your new code on phpbin you need a comma after the line:</p>

<pre><code> data: "full_name="+$("#full_name").val()+"&amp;usr_email="+$("#usr_email").val(), // &lt;-- COMMA HERE
</code></pre>

<p>Or, in your old code (which is nicer since you don't have to deal with concatenating the data url yourself), you were missing a comma also, between the two lines:</p>

<pre><code>data: {full_name : $('#full_name').val(), // &lt;-- COMMA HERE
         usr_email : $('#usr_email').val()},
</code></pre>

<p>ALSO, you need a semicolon after this line:</p>

<pre><code>alert(msg); // &lt;-- SEMICOLON HERE
</code></pre>

<p>Using Swing on Java 6u16, WinXP SP3<br>
Hello to all. I need some help, please, with the following case. 
Basically I use a JTable inside a JScrollPane, that on the scrollPane I apply component orientation of right-to-left. The final result that I get is such that the table is indeed is attached to the right, but the header is placed to the left, when the scroll pane is bigger than the table width. This is happens only with custom table headers and AUTO_RESIZE_OFF on table columns (to get horizontal scrolling).<p> Second (related) problem is with dragging the vertical grid lines to resize the columns - the header line moves to the left, when the table column's line moves to the right.
I have 2 test cases. The first uses the code from <a href="http://www.swebb99.f2s.com/GroupableHeader/" rel="nofollow">http://www.swebb99.f2s.com/GroupableHeader/</a>. This is open source implementation of the table header that is used to group some sub-column headers.
Please add to main() in GroupableColumnExample.java:</p>

<pre><code>frame.applyComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation.RIGHT_TO_LEFT);
</code></pre>

<p><p>Second test case uses JIDE (www.jidesoft.com) implementation of nested table header for the same purpose and with the same results.</p>

<pre><code>import java.awt.ComponentOrientation;
import javax.swing.*;
import com.jidesoft.grid.JideTable;

public class TestCase {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Demo");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        JideTable table = new JideTable(
            new Object[][]{{"1", "2"}}, new String[]{"3", "4"});
        //this line adds the custom header and the problem begins
        table.setNestedTableHeader(true);
        table.setAutoResizeMode(JTable.AUTO_RESIZE_OFF);
        frame.add(new JScrollPane(table));
        //make frame bigger than needed to display the table
        frame.setSize(200, 200);
        frame.applyComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation.RIGHT_TO_LEFT);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}

<p>Re-organize the data to a single array for sorting:</p>

<p>Hello, I would like to know this:</p>

<p>Let's assume I let system allocate memory for an array e.g. MyArray. How then computer knows when I use this MyArray variable where to look? How are  these named variables managed at low level?</p>

<p>In short I want to know the relation between defined variable and physical address in memory.</p>

<p>I hope you can understand as this is little cumbersome explanation I couldn't find better words.</p>

<p>I've recently bought a copy of EZDrummer, a VST plugin that acts as a virtual drumkit. I'd really like to hook into it from Ruby code so that I can create loops and drum patterns programmatically. To be honest I am not sure even where to start. Presumably I have to create a VST host which can load the plugin and then hook into it somehow. I am a Ruby developer so that's the language I'd be looking to implement this in. Any pointers in the right direction?</p>

<p>If you aren't working with HTTP, you will have to build your own connectors for Tomcat.  When I've written these types of applications, I've just written them as standard Java applications.  On Windows machines, I use a service wrapper that allows them to be part of the Windows startup process.  On non-windows machines, you just need to add a start up script.</p>

<p>Since you're  trying to create a new workspace with the same name....</p>

<p>At a higher level you want to think of a workspace as mapping the <em>current</em> backing configuration to the <em>current</em> location on disk.  With this in mind, you'll likely find yourself removing workspaces less.    For example, I have a single 'mainline_dev' named workspace that gets moved around to many active project streams over the course of the month.   Once I'm done on a given activity (say for the week), I'll promote my work (assign to my story/task/bugfix), and then reparent/move my workspace to the next stream to work.  Upon 'update', my local disk fully mirror's the new stream location (hierarchy).</p>

<p>Thus, if you more generically name your workspace, you'll find a pattern of reusing them rather than removing and recreating.</p>

<p>HTH!</p>

<p>Well, I googled a bit and was able to find
<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/223/1/Open-With-dialog-appears-when-double-clicking-on-a-mapped-network-drive-in-My-Computer.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>.<br/></p>

<p>You should also try opening the drive by clicking Explore in the context menu and see if there is an autorun.inf file that you could have copied by accident. It's probably going to be a hidden one, and maybe even a protected one, so check your Folder Option to make sure it shows all files. Although, that does sounds like something a virus would do.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;curses.h&gt;

int main () {

int y, x;
getyx( curscr, y, x);

printf("x=%i, y=%i", x, y);
return 0; }
</code></pre>

<p>gcc a.c -lcurses -o a</p>

<p>x=-1, y=-1</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Hello everyone, this is a basich question about properly setting up the lamp server to work with eclipse and xdebugger.
I have lamp server installed and working properly.
I have eclipse pdt as described here <a href="http://blog.yogarine.com/2009/10/eclipse-plugin-packages-for-ubuntu.html" rel="nofollow">Eclipse plugin PPA for Ubuntu by Yogarine</a>
and it is properly installed.
I have installed xdebugger and configure the xdebug.ini file as described here <a href="http://techmania.wordpress.com/2008/07/02/debugging-php-in-eclipse-using-xdebug/" rel="nofollow">Debugging PHP in Eclipse using XDebug</a></p>

<p>How do i configure all these three components to work together. The Xdebugger requires the path to the php executable to work. I added <em>"/usr/bin/php5"</em> as the executable, but it doesn't seem to work properly. Can someone please help. Thanks</p>

<p>In the following code, I try to get the local time and greenwich time and find the difference between them. But the output shows both the time values are equal:</p>

<pre><code>diff=0 iTm1=16:34 iTm2=16:34 &lt;-----[gmtime is 13:34 actualy]
</code></pre>

<p>When I just retreive gmtime, it works correctly. But when I retreive both local and gmtime, gmtime becomes equal to localtime.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
int main()
{
        time_t iTime;
        struct tm * iTm1;
        struct tm * iTm2;
        int iTimeDifferenceInMinutes;

        time(&amp;iTime);
        iTm1=gmtime(&amp;iTime);
        iTm2=localtime(&amp;iTime);
        iTimeDifferenceInMinutes=(int)((iTm2-&gt;tm_hour - iTm1-&gt;tm_hour)) * 60;
        printf("diff=%d iTm1=%d:%d iTm2=%d:%d\n", iTimeDifferenceInMinutes,
                        iTm1-&gt;tm_hour, iTm1-&gt;tm_min,
                        iTm2-&gt;tm_hour, iTm2-&gt;tm_min);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have a mistake but I couldn't find it...
May someone show me my fault please..?</p>

<p>I would like to test if *.ico images are valid icons in PHP. I tried to use getimagesize function but it doesn't support ICO files.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Authentication" rel="nofollow">Twitter docs, basic auth is being turned off this month</a>. </p>

<p>I can see the benefit of OAuth when your service accepts third party user twitter login/id's, but for a simple twitter bot that simply post to a single bot twitter account, does OAuth seem like overkill?</p>

<p>In the case of the latter, what's the least resource-expendful PHP way to get OAuth to auth for the simple purpose of posting to twitter. </p>

<p>That depends.. RFID is a very broad field.</p>

<p>There are very simple tags that really only send back their ID when activated using a fixed function logic. I doubt many of them are still in use.</p>

<p>And then there are very sophisticated ones that even run programs written in JAVA and have crypto-processors and other funky stuff built in. </p>

<p>One example of this is the SmartMX Mifare card from NXP. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIFARE" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIFARE</a> </p>

<p>Note: Don't confuse active and passive tags with processor/no processor tags. A tag is active if it has it's own power supply. That does not imply that it has a processor and vice versa. </p>

<p>Maybe you should call <code>initscr();</code> before trying to use curses ?</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;curses.h&gt;

int main (void)
{
    int y = 0, x = 0;

    initscr();
    getyx(curscr, y, x);
    printw("x = %d, y = %d", x, y);
    refresh();
    getchar();
    endwin();
    return 0;
}

<p>You'll find that reading at least <em>some</em> of the documentation for a programming library is time well invested, e.g. <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/" rel="nofollow">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/</a></p>

<p>If you are seeing <code>???</code> in the webbrowser, then changing the browser's locale/charset as suggested by others really won't help much. Only if you were seeing <code>�</code>, empty squares and/or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake" rel="nofollow">Mojibake</a>, then it <em>may</em> indeed help. Also installing fonts really won't help much as well. If there wasn't a font for it, you would in Firefox have seen squares with hexcodes inside and in IE empty squares and really not <code>???</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>???</code> can here have only one cause: you are writing those characters to the HTTP response using the wrong encoding. The average webserver will replace unknown characters by <code>?</code>. The webbrowser doesn't do that, it is just displaying them as is. <em>Actually, there is in theory another possible cause; the DB will do the same when you're <strong>inserting</strong> unknown characters, but that's less or more excluded here.</em></p>

<p>It's not clear what view technology you're using, but since you're talking about Java and a webbrowser, I'll assume that you're using JSP/Servlet (in the future, please mention and tag as such, so that the right audience will be reached).</p>

<p>If you're displaying those characters using JSP, then you need to add the following to the top of your JSP page to instruct the servletcontainer to write those characters using the right encoding:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ page pageEncoding="UTF-8" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you're writing those characters manually using a Servlet, then you need to set the HTTP servlet response to use the right encoding as follows <em>before</em> you write any character to it:</p>

<pre><code>response.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8");
</code></pre>

<p>I've been using that kind of methods on and off but never really understood how they behaved.</p>

<p>Every time I try to use them, I find myself poking in the dark as I try different aspect and it never seem to do what I expect it to.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument, I'm trying to convert the frame I get from UIKeyboard's notification.</p>

<p>In landscape mode, I get this NSRect:</p>

<pre><code>UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey = NSRect: {{406, 0}, {362, 1024}}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to convert it to the proper rect (swap x/y, width and height) so I do </p>

<pre><code>CGRect compatibleRect = [self convertRect:[[[notif userInfo] objectForKey:UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] CGRectValue] toView:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>But the rect becomes: </p>

<pre><code>compatibleRect = CGRect: {{406,406}, {362, 1024}}
</code></pre>

<p>I assume what you are looking for is how runtime systems do <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_memory_allocation" rel="nofollow">dynamic memory allocation</a>. Depending on the programming language / runtime however, memory can be also allocated on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation" rel="nofollow">stack</a>.</p>

<p>There was a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap">similar question</a> that you may have a look at too.</p>

<p>What it does, conceptually, can be determined just by looking at the type: It unwraps or flattens the outer monadic container/computation and returns the monadic value(s) produced therein.</p>

<p>How it actually does this is determined by the kind of Monad you are dealing with. For example, for the List monad, 'join' is equivalent to <a href="http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.1/html/libraries/base-4.2.0.0/Prelude.html#v%3aconcat" rel="nofollow">concat</a>. </p>

<p>ico files are mainly image files, if you change a jpeg or gif/png into ico extension it works fine,so if you keep image type cheking it will do the job </p>

<p>You are still in console mode: try <code>getmaxyx</code> to show the number of lines and columns of the window, you should see the problem.</p>

#include &lt;curses.h&gt;

int main()
{

  WINDOW * MyWindow;
  MyWindow=initscr();

  int y, x;

  printf("x=%i, y=%i", x, y);

<p>A while ago I wanted to buy a "serious" Java book as well.  I considered buying Core Java, but I didn't like the fact that it deals with all sort of aspects of not only Java, but also many of the libraries that come with Sun's JDK.  This is all <em>but</em> "core" knowledge to me!  I wanted an introductory book on Java that goes deep.  This is exactly what Thinking in Java is: I can only recommend that book!  Although you specifically stated that book is for now out of question, you might want to revisit that opinion.  Thinking in Java could be the first and last book on the topic "core Java" you need.</p>

<p>A variable stores the address of the memory so when your program ask for the value in myVar it is actually getting a memory address.</p>

<p>A bit like when you search for a website. You my ask for www.google.com to be displayed but it's actually the ip of google that is used to get the information.</p>

<p>conj is used in (conj coll item), for example (conj #{} "Stu").</p>

<p>But, I found this example in 'Programming Clojure' book page16.</p>

<p>I guess (conj visitors username) would be the correct usage. What's the secret?</p>

<p>If the view has no subviews, create it programmatically. If it has subviews, create a XIB file (ie use Interface Builder).</p>

<p>The best advice I can give from a learning perspective is to find a real problem to solve rather than something fictional. Look round your house, think about your life and what makes you inefficient or frustrated and solve that, or even just begin to solve it. Not only will this give some focus and motivation but you have the chance of coming out of it with the start of something useful to others too. </p>

<p>Don't expect to create the next Google in a week but in my experience, 'play projects' can just be too shallow and simple to learn real world techniques from and tackling something real creates a better learning environment.</p>

<p>I'm developing under Pylons using Mako templates. The problem is that I need to assign a string from some attribute of tmpl_context to a JavaScript variable in a page body. The additional problem is that this string can be quite arbitrary, ie can contain such characters like ", ', &lt;, >, etc... Is there a common way to do such assignment?
I've tried something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
    ...
    var a = "${c.my_string}";
    ...
&lt;/script&gt;

<p>I have a JPanel that I have created a MouseListener for and I am seeing some behavior that I can't explain. </p>

<p>Usually when I click the mouse within the JPanel, I see the following events fire:</p>

<pre><code>mousePressed
mouseReleased
mouseClicked
</code></pre>

<p>On some occasions, I don't see the mouseClicked event fire, I only see:</p>

<pre><code>mousePressed
mouseReleased
</code></pre>

<p>I don't think I'm doing anything out of the ordinary when I click these times. Could anyone explain why I might not be seeing the mouseClicked event?</p>

<p>Both localtime and gmtime use static memory in the clib for their processing. So when you use one, it overwrites the previous call.</p>

<p>You need to call gmtime, then pull the variables you want out and store it in a separate location. Then call localtime, and do your comparison.</p>

<p>OR, you can use the reentrant versions of these calls (localtime_r, gmtime_r) which you have to supply your own memory, but there won't be any overwriting of data.</p>

<p>I recommend getting used to using the reentrant versions of these calls, then bugs like this won't show their ugly head!</p>

<p>Looks like you have <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.php" rel="nofollow">magic quotes</a> turned on.</p>

<p>You should actually <strong>turn off</strong> the magic quotes from <strong>php.ini</strong>.</p>

<p>Or from within script, you can handle it like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (get_magic_quotes_gpc())
{
  $str = stripslashes($str);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use the <code>$str</code> variable normally.</p>

<p>Personal experience - IB all the way. I prefer to see what I am actually doing instead of guessing what ([myView size].height / 2 + 15) % 3 would look like.</p>

<p>It seems like you might be having some trouble with <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.php" rel="nofollow">Magic Quotes</a>. You can disable them by following <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/info.configuration.php#ini.magic-quotes-gpc" rel="nofollow">the instructions here</a>. It's highly recommended that you disable them instead of sidestepping them by using a function to just strip the slashes out.</p>

<p><code>.replace</code> doesn't modify the string. It <em>returns</em> the replaced string.</p>

<p>(Also the pattern <code>/^0/g</code> is wrong, as commented by @santa).</p>

<p>Quote from the Linux man page:</p>

<blockquote>

The  gmtime() function [...snip...] <b>The
       return  value  points to a statically allocated struct which might be overwritten by subsequent calls to
       any of the date and time functions.</b>  The gmtime_r() function does the same, but stores  the  data  in  a
       user-supplied struct.

 <p>
<p>
  The localtime() function  [...snip...]  <b>The return value points to a statically
       allocated struct which might be overwritten by subsequent calls to any of the date and  time  functions.</b>
       The  localtime_r()  function  does the same, but stores the data in a user-supplied struct.  It need not
       set tzname.

</blockquote>

<p>The <code>gmtime</code> and <code>localtime</code> functions each return a pointer to a fixed buffer. It seems that on your implementation, they use the same buffer, so the call to <code>gmtime</code> fills that buffer, and then the call to <code>localtime</code> fills that buffer with different data.</p>

<p>If you have <code>gmtime_r</code> and <code>localtime_r</code>, use them. (You may need to include the line <code>#define _POSIX_SOURCE</code> or something similar before <code>#include &lt;time.h&gt;</code>) You'll need to allocate memory for the two <code>struct tm</code> objects.</p>

<pre><code>struct tm local_tm, gm_tm;
time(&amp;iTime);
gmtime_r(&amp;iTime, &amp;gm_tm);
localtime_r(&amp;iTime, &amp;local_tm);
</code></pre>

<p>Older systems don't have the <code>_r</code> versions (they were added because the plain versions can't easily be used in a multithreaded program). Then you have to copy the data before the next call to either of the two functions.</p>

<pre><code>struct tm local_tm, gm_tm;
time(&amp;iTime);
memcpy(&amp;gm_tm, gmtime(&amp;iTime), sizeof(gm_tm));
memcpy(&amp;local_tm, localtime(&amp;iTime), sizeof(local_tm));
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming you are testing the variables and not multiple lines:</p>

<pre><code>private var testVar = testVar.replace(/^\d*(.+)$/,"$1");

<p>I have multiple checkboxlist controls on a webpage. Along with that i have the same number of buttons on that page. Initially all the checkboxlist controls are hidden. When user clicks on a button, corresponding checkboxlist controls gets visible making others hidden and allows user to select the options. </p>

<p>On postback, if user clicks on the same button again, the corresponding checkboxlist gets visible but the item selection is not retained. However, this happens only in IE. This works fine in FireFox. I am using JQuery to toggle the visibility of checkboxlist.</p>

<p>I guess the problem is because i am toggling the visibility of checkboxlist which IE doesnt seem to like. What is the solution to this problem?</p>

<p>I know this has already been answered, but I think its worth to note:</p>

<p>The WebBrowser control provides a wrapper around the HTTP stack and the trident rendering engine.  This is independent of Internet Explorer, which essentially is a shell around this same set of technologies.  When you uninstall IE, you are not uninstalling Trident (MSHTML).</p>

<p>hi is there a build'in function of python that does on python.array what <a href="http://www.scipy.org/Numpy_Example_List_With_Doc#head-82d26af744a08992cf3422d6df9dc9e276e78263" rel="nofollow">argsort()</a> does on a numpy.array?</p>

<p>I recently upgraded to XCode 4.  I imported a project from 3.2 and started a build.  I got two errors immediately, regarding missing documentation.  The project built successfully regardless, but I'd like to remedy the issue.</p>

<p>I compile with the core-plot framework, and the error is specific to some missing files in doxygen.app.  After some Googling I've discovered that this is some sort of documentation engine.  </p>

<p>Is there a way I cam either make XCode ignore the error (and not display it) or get the missing documentation so it stops bugging me?</p>

<p>Your mistake in using pointers to <code>struct tm</code> without actually having a variable holding the memory.  Here is a repaired version:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    time_t iTime;
    struct tm iTm1;
    struct tm iTm2;
    int iTimeDifferenceInMinutes;

    time(&amp;iTime);
    iTm1=*gmtime(&amp;iTime);
    iTm2=*localtime(&amp;iTime);
    iDiff=(int)((iTm2.tm_hour - iTm1.tm_hour)) * 60;
    printf("diff=%d iTm1=%d:%d iTm2=%d:%d\n", iDiff,
       iTm1.tm_hour, iTm1.tm_min,
       iTm2.tm_hour, iTm2.tm_min);

<p>Hi guys, as the question says, I am trying to insert one or more tick box values into one database field, preferably in a comma delimited format.</p>

<p>So if the user chooses tick box one and tick box two, the input into the database will be inserted as tickOne, tickTwo, etc etc</p>

<p>How could I go about doing that?
Maybe using jQuery or Javascript?</p>

<p>Thanx in advance!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm trying to send some emails with some images. If I display the images on a webpage they are 100x wide and 100px tall, but if the image is taller than 100px it will get the excess pixels hidden.  </p>

<p>If I try to send it in an email, I can't get it to clip the excess height of the image.<br>
Here's what I'm sending in the email:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img  src="&lt;?php echo base_url().$thumb;?&gt;"  style="border:1px solid #35538d;width:100px;height:100px;overflow:hidden;text-align:center;background-color:#f0f0f0;" rel="nofollow" alt="Profile Photo"&gt;

<p>I always start with Interface Builder. Dropping down into code is sometimes necessary, but in the early stages of view design the visual layout of IB makes prototyping orders of magnitude quicker and easier.</p>

<p>Like Gumbo already pointed out in the comments to this question and like you have also been told in a number of your previous questions as well, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454">Regex aint the right tool for parsing HTML</a>.</p>

<p>The following will use <a href="http://de2.php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php" rel="nofollow">DOM</a> to get the first following sibling of any strong elements with a class attribute of <code>nfpd</code>. In the case of the example HTML, this would be the content of the TextNode, e.g. <code>: example world</code>.</p>

<p>Example HTML:</p>

<pre><code>$html = &lt;&lt;&lt; HTML
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong class="nfpd"&gt;Actors&lt;/strong&gt;: example world &lt;br /&gt;
    something else
&lt;/p&gt;
HTML;
</code></pre>

<p>And extraction with <a href="http://de2.php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php" rel="nofollow">DOM</a></p>

<pre><code>libxml_use_internal_errors(TRUE);
$dom = new DOMDocument();
$dom-&gt;loadHTML($html);
$xPath = new DOMXPath($dom);
libxml_clear_errors();

$nodes = $xPath-&gt;query('//strong[@class="nfpd"]/following-sibling::text()[1]');
foreach($nodes as $node) {
    echo $node-&gt;nodeValue; // : example world 
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also do it withouth an XPath, though it gets more verbose then:</p>

<pre><code>$nodes = $dom-&gt;getElementsByTagName('strong');
foreach($nodes as $node) {
    if($node-&gt;hasAttribute('class') &amp;&amp;
       $node-&gt;getAttribute('class') === 'nfpd' &amp;&amp;
       $node-&gt;nextSibling) {
        echo $node-&gt;nextSibling-&gt;nodeValue; // : example world 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Removing the colon and whitespace is trivial: Use <a href="http://de2.php.net/manual/en/function.trim.php" rel="nofollow"><code>trim</code></a>.</p>

<p>The "secret" is that alter is a special function that is called in a transaction on a ref, and it has the effect of inserting the current value of the ref as the first parameter to whichever function is supplied as its second argument.</p>

<p>In fact the normal usage for conj with a ref would be:</p>

<pre><code>(conj @visitors username)
</code></pre>

<p>So alter roughly translates as follows:</p>

<pre><code>(alter vistors conj username)
=&gt; (ref-set visitors (conj @visitors username))
</code></pre>

<p>For relational algebra this might be handy:</p>

<p><a href="http://db.grussell.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://db.grussell.org/index.html</a></p>

<p>A good starting book for beginners according to me is this, although it is not covering all aspects of the exam paper.</p>

<p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201694719" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Database-Design-Mere-Mortals-Hands/dp/0201694719</a></p>

<p>Don't forget to actually practice on a real world database. That is my ten cents.</p>

<p>It's quite possible that the CSS you are trying is just not supported by your email client. Email clients generally support a greatly reduced subset of HTML and only minimal CSS. When composing HTML emails it is often a case of <em>back to basics</em>... HTML table layout etc. in order to get the greatest support.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> IMO trying to <em>crop</em> an image using HTML/CSS is going to be impossible if you want this to work across <strong>all</strong> email clients. The relevant properties that could help to achieve this: background-image, height, overflow, clip, etc. just aren't supported across the board. So, although it will work for some, it won't for others.</p>

<p>An alternative might be reduce the width so that the height is always 100px. You would need to calculate the width server-side in order to maintain the appropriate aspect ratio.</p>

<p>However, I think that may be the best solution would be to generate a(nother) square 100px image server-side with PHP?</p>

<p>The application correctly connects as the server machine account. Processes running as <code>LocalSystem</code> or as <code>Network Service</code> authenticate over the network as the machine, <code>domain\machine$</code>, this is by design, intentional and desired.</p>

<p>You can grant <code>domain\server$</code> login rights into SQL as needed. Or you can change the application to run under a different account (I assume the application is a service?).</p>

<p>If you want to pass the values as a string, say comma delimited like you mentioned in jquery you could set the value using <a href="http://api.jquery.com/map/" rel="nofollow"><code>.map()</code></a>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(".mySelector:checkbox").change(function() {
  var values = $(".mySelector:checkbox:checked").map(function() {
                 return this.value;
               }).get().join(', ');
  $("#myHiddenInput").val(values);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Every time a checkbox changes, it'll re-do the string portion, re-serializing the result, so on postback it should be the current UI selection.  <a href="http://api.jquery.com/map/" rel="nofollow"><code>.map()</code></a> gets an array of the values of the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/" rel="nofollow"><code>:checked</code></a> elements with your <code>mySelector</code> class, then we're just doing a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Objects/Array/join" rel="nofollow"><code>.join()</code></a> to convert that array into a string and using <a href="http://api.jquery.com/val/" rel="nofollow"><code>.val()</code></a> to set the hidden input for this to that string.</p>

<p>This assumes markup like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="checkbox" class="mySelector" value="tickOne" /&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" class="mySelector" value="tickTwo" /&gt;
....
&lt;input type="hidden" id="myHiddenInput" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I share Your disappointment about those titles. They are highly recommended, but contain not so few examples of bad practices. Long and complicated methods, mixing abstraction levels in a single function... This style certainly doesn't strive for code reuse. Readability also suffers. Lots of other complaints...</p>

<p>Maybe they are not focused completely and only at the core, but here are few of the best I read so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0071591060" rel="nofollow">Sun's Certified Java Programmer for Java 6</a>: This book can be a real eye opener even for seasoned Java developers. This I'd recommend the most since it covers a lot basic and intermediate topics written by people with a lot of technical discipline.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321356683" rel="nofollow">Effective Java</a>: Written by the author of Java Collection Framework gives deep insight about why and how certain Java API parts work and how to make most effective use of them. Also contains few confessions about controversial parts of Java API.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596007126" rel="nofollow">Head First: Design Patterns</a>: Nice introduction to design patterns. While it's certainly unique in style, the book approaches the topic from real-world problems.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1430209739" rel="nofollow">Practical API design</a>: We, as programmers, always produce code which is used by others. This book focuses on how to make using of your code or library as plausible as possible. If you're not writing only for yourself that really matters.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0132350882" rel="nofollow">Clean Code</a>: "Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code.

<li><p><a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0321349601" rel="nofollow">Java Concurrency in Practice</a>: It's certainly not core, but a great one. It tackles concurrent programming. Processor clock rates aren't rising so quickly as before. Some say that the multi-core processors can extend Moore's Law in future years, so it's good to know how to use them. Especially worth noting are <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/java/libraryview.jsp?search_by=practice%3a" rel="nofollow">articles on IBM tech library</a> written by the same author.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Disclaimer: They aren't strictly Core Java alternatives. While I learned the essentials of Java I faced a certain point I got stuck in. At the other hand books I recommend gave back the wind in my sails. And quite astonishingly, gave me a much better understanding about Core Java than books which advertise that in title.</p>

<p>I'm trying to determine whether Object1 will collide with Object2 given the following information:</p>

<p>1) Objects' bounding boxes (uses bounded-box collision detection)</p>

<p>2) Objects' speeds</p>

<p>3) Object's current locations (x, y coordinate)</p>

<p>4) Objects' directions (Up, Down, Left, or Right)</p>

<p>For a bit of imagery, imagine the objects traveling on a 2D grid, and they can only move on the lines of that grid.</p>

<p>So given the above information, I need an efficient, but readable algorithm to determine whether those objects will collide. By efficient I mean constant time with time spent on computations minimized. Psuedocode or a link is fine.</p>

<p>I have now started writing a tool to do what I originally asked about. The current code can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.github.com/mchr3k/org.inmemprofiler/" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.github.com/mchr3k/org.inmemprofiler/</a></p>

<p>So far I have managed to get a textual histogram of all object allocations by instance count. This does not include array allocations which are handled differently.</p>

<p>I am now working on adding instance size information along with tracking of array allocations by using the JVMTI.</p>

<p>There is no built-in function, but it's easy to assemble one out of the terrific tools Python makes available:</p>

<pre><code>def argsort(seq):
    # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3071415/efficient-method-to-calculate-the-rank-vector-of-a-list-in-python
    return sorted(range(len(seq)), key=seq.__getitem__)

x=[5,2,1,10]

print(argsort(x))
# [2, 1, 0, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>It works on Python <code>array.array</code>s the same way:</p>

<pre><code>import array
x=array.array('d', [5, 2, 1, 10])
print(argsort(x))
# [2, 1, 0, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>Hi almog.ori and all wise guy out there,
I had a failure when applying your code. When I getting list of items, it return null but when I alert in onclick event, eventually it push value into that array. Can you help me with this, thank in advance..
Sample Code :</p>

<pre><code>var list = new cookieList("test");
$(img).one('click', function(i){
while($('.selected').length &lt; 3) {
    $(this).parent()
        .addClass("selected")
        .append(setup.config.overlay);

    //$.cookie(setup.config.COOKIE_NAME, d, setup.config.OPTS);
    var index = $(this).parent().index();

    // suppose this array go into cookies.. but failed
    list.add( index );

    var count = 'You have selected : &lt;span&gt;' + $('.selected').length + '&lt;/span&gt; deals';
    if( $('.total').length ){
        $('.total').html(count);
    }

} 
});
</code></pre>

<p>When I check through Firefox cookies, it seem doesn't save cookie session.</p>

<p>Tomcat doesn't really buy you much if you don't use HTTP. </p>

<p>However, I was forced to move a non-HTTP server to Tomcat for following reasons,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We need some simple web pages to display the status/stats of the server so I need a web server. Java 6 comes with a simple HTTP server but Tomcat is more robust.</p></li>
<li><p>Our operation tools are geared to run Tomcat only and standalone app just falls off radar in their monitoring system.</p></li>
<li><p>We use DBCP for database pooling and everyone seems more comfortable to use it under Tomcat.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The memory foot-print of Tomcat (a few MBs) is not an issue for us so we haven't seen any performance change since moved to Tomcat.</p>

<p>We have a database on a server with enough RAM to hold the entire db. Is there any merit and/or drawbacks to preloading the data into memory after a long period of inactivity?</p>

<p>Other factors during this nightly process:
Balance data are recreated from another app/database/server.
Indexes and stats get refreshed
full backup to disk</p>

<p>then data would be preloaded.</p>

<p>Combining <code>&lt;xsl:import&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;xsl:param&gt;</code> seems to work fine for me:</p>

<p>main.xsl:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:param name="title" select="'Page title'" /&gt;
  &lt;xsl:include href="head.xsl"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>head.xsl:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match="head"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
      &lt;xsl:value-of select="$title"/&gt;
    &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Applying main.xsl on a file containing <code>&lt;head /&gt;</code> produces <code>&lt;title&gt;Page title&lt;/title&gt;</code> as expected. If this doesn't help you, you should post some code where you actually use <code>&lt;xsl:import&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;xsl:param&gt;</code> (and that doesn't work).</p>

<p>hi please can you help me - i need to detect transparent pixels - thanks in advance.

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>is there a way to add the usage of a table/reference in the caption of the reference/table in latex?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{Name} &amp; \textbf{Description} \\
        Foo &amp; bar \\
        Foo &amp; bar
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Nice Table. Used on pages [2,3,4].}
    \label{tab:table}
\end{table}
</code></pre>

<p>I would like the "Used on pages[2,3,4]." to appear automatically and linked to the correct reference, to all the locations in the document that use \ref{tab:table}.</p>

<p>Anyone knows a package that takes care of this?</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Browsers can resize images based on the attributes you specify.</p>

<p>However I imagine most resizing is done server side, preferably prior to the request.  With the speed of current CPUs and for the sake of simplicity and possibly bandwidth saving, is it ever acceptable to leave image resizing to the browser?</p>

<p>You might want to have a look at the <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/" rel="nofollow">Guide to CSS support in email clients</a> page to see which CSS attributes you can and cannot use for the various email clients.</p>

<p>For an explanation of the recursion see Gilles answer.</p>

<p>Your code has some problems. First it will be hard to implement the required <code>swap</code> as a function in C, since C lacks the concept of call by reference. You could try to do this with a macro, but then you'd either have to use the <em>exclusive-or</em> trick to swap values in place, or use a temporary variable.</p>

<p>Then your repeated use of <code>strlen</code> on every recursion level blows up your complexity of the program. As you give it this is done at every iteration of every recursion level. Since your string even changes (because of the <code>swap</code>s) the compiler wouldn't even be able to notice that this is always the same. So he wouldn't be able to optimize anything. Searching for the terminating <code>'\0'</code> in your string would dominate all other instructions by far if you implement it like that. </p>

<p>First, find the time interval during which the boxes will overlap on the X axis.
Second, find the time interval during which the boxes will overlap on the Y axis.
Finally, check if the two time intervals overlap. If so, the earliest point in time that is in both intervals is the moment they are going to collide.</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    $(function() {
  $("#continue").click(function () {
    $.ajax({
       type: "POST",
       url: "dbc.php?check=First",
    data: {full_name : $('#full_name').val(),
         usr_email : $('#usr_email').val()},

       success: function(msg){
            if(msg==1){
              $("#First_1").hide();
              $("#Next_2").toggle(); 
           }else{
              alert(msg);
           }         
        }
     });
     return false;
  });
}); 
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's dbc.php?check=First <a href="http://phpbin.net/x/249121011" rel="nofollow">phpbin.net/x/249121011</a></p>

<p>I'm using iTextSharp at the moment and I would like to use a custom font.</p>

<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>

<pre><code>PrivateFontCollection fonts;
FontFamily family = LoadFontFamily("TheFont.ttf", out fonts);
var reader = new PdfReader("KurtBonne_test.pdf");
var stamper = new PdfStamper(reader,
new FileStream("Kurt Bonne_test_withtext.pdf", FileMode.Create));
var over = stamper.GetOverContent(1);
over.BeginText();
var bf = BaseFont.CreateFont(BaseFont.HELVETICA, BaseFont.CP1252, BaseFont.NOT_EMBEDDED);

//var bf = BaseFont.CreateFont("Test", BaseFont.CP1252, BaseFont.EMBEDDED, true,?,?)
over.SetFontAndSize(bf, 10);
over.SetTextMatrix(0, 140);
over.ShowText("page " + 0);
over.EndText();
stamper.Close();

<p>Now, apparently, the BaseFont.CreateFont has an overloaded method with this signature:</p>

<pre><code>BaseFont.CreateFont(string name, string encoding, bool cached, byte[] ttfAfm, byte[] pfb);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, how do I use TheFont.ttf? Somehow I need a bytearray (ttfAfm)...</p>

<p>Its non obvious because its so obvious. Basically, you extend html helper's extension:</p>

<pre><code>public static HtmlString Foo(this HtmlHelper helper, string param)
{
    //do whatever
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can get at request context, etc, from HtmlHelper.</p>

<p>Your best approach is to work out:</p>

<ol>
<li>The linear time range (possibly never) in which the x co-ordinates will overlap</li>
<li>The linear time range (possibly never) in which the y co-ordinates will overlap</li>
</ol>

<p>And then test if the two time ranges intersect. This will as an added bonus give you the collision time.</p>

<p>This will be a simple constant time operation overall.</p>

<p>It might be a bandwith problem. But otherwise, why not.</p>

<p>If you want to grab files using HTTP, then <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/" rel="nofollow">libcURL</a> is probably your best bet in C.  However, if you are using this as a way to learn network programming, then you are going to have to learn a bit more about HTTP before you can retrieve a file.</p>

<p>What you are seeing in your current program is that you need to send an explicit request for the file before you can retrieve it.  I would start by reading through <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616" rel="nofollow">RFC2616</a>.  Don't try to understand it all - it is a lot to read for this example.  Read the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-1" rel="nofollow">first section</a> to get an understanding of how HTTP works, then read sections <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-4" rel="nofollow">4, 5, and 6</a> to understand the basic message format.</p>

<p>Here is an example of what an HTTP request for the stackoverflow Questions page looks like:</p>

<pre><code>GET http://stackoverflow.com/questions HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: stackoverflow.com:80\r\n
Connection: close\r\n
Accept-Encoding: identity, *;q=0\r\n
\r\n
</code></pre>

<p>I believe that is a minimal request.  I added the CRLFs explicitly to show that a blank line is used to terminate the request header block <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5" rel="nofollow">as described in RFC2616</a>.  If you leave out the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.3" rel="nofollow"><code>Accept-Encoding</code></a> header, then the result document will probably be transfered as a gzip-compressed stream since HTTP allows for this explicitly unless you tell the server that you do not want it.</p>

<p>The server response also contains HTTP headers for the meta-data describing the response.  Here is an example of a response from the previous request:</p>

<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
Server: nginx\r\n
Date: Sun, 01 Aug 2010 13:54:56 GMT\r\n
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\n
Connection: close\r\n
Cache-Control: private\r\n
Content-Length: 49731\r\n
\r\n
\r\n
\r\n
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" ... 49,667 bytes follow
</code></pre>

<p>This simple example should give you an idea what you are getting into implementing if you want to grab files using HTTP.  This is the best case, most simple example.  This isn't something that I would undertake lightly, but it is probably the best way to learn and appreciate HTTP.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a simple way to learn network programming, this is a decent way to start.  I would recommend picking up a copy of <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0201633469" rel="nofollow">TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1</a> and <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0131411551" rel="nofollow">UNIX Network Programming, Volume 1</a>.  These are probably the best way to really learn how to write network-based applications.  I would probably start by writing an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" rel="nofollow">FTP client</a> since <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc959" rel="nofollow">FTP</a> is a much simpler protocol to start with.</p>

<p>If you are trying to learn the details associated with HTTP, then:</p>

<ol>
<li>Buy <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1565925092" rel="nofollow">HTTP: the Definitive Guide</a> and read it</li>
<li>Read <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616" rel="nofollow">RFC2616</a> until you understand it
<ul>
<li>Try examples using <code>telnet server 80</code> and typing in requests by hand</li>
<li>Download the cURL client and use the <code>--verbose</code> and <code>--include</code> command line options so that you can see what is happening</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation_2up.pdf" rel="nofollow">Fielding's dissertation</a> until HTTP really makes sense.</li>
</ol>

<p>Just don't plan on writing your own HTTP client for <em>enterprise use</em>.  You do not want to do that, trust me as one who has been maintaining such a mistake for a little while now...</p>

<p>I give you what I want in PHP :</p>

<pre><code>foreach($myarray as $key=&gt;$value) { ${$key} = $value; }
</code></pre>

<p>Now, can we do it with JS/jQuery ?</p>

<p>This is the jQuery input, I want the classTD value as key, in other words the equivalent of the famous PHP statement ${$key} in the example above:</p>

<pre><code>data  = {};
$('#resul_rech_doc_fact tr.document-2 td').each(function(index) {
var classTD = $(this).attr('class');
var contentTD = $(this).text();
data = $.extend(data , { classTD : contentTD });
});
</code></pre>

<p>I have a project coming up for client who is basically happy with how he manages his website. It's lots of HTML files (around 300 of them) that he insists on keeping flat HTML files so can easily edit and manage them using Dreamweaver. His site has a lot of traffic and so I'm looking into options of keeping things simple for him. He does insist on this method for the time being, I hope to win him around eventually. I'm slowly moving him off his expensive shared hosting package (he maxes it out constantly due to traffic) and getting him on a VPS so I have more control over what I can install and the resources are more flexible etc.</p>

<p>My issue is, there is some parts of the site that are in PHP. The small admin area he uses to do his newsletters for example sits separately away and he still requires this function. I'm thinking that since I'd have him on a server I can install what I like on, I want to start incorporating Django into the site. I'd much more prefer to do Django development for any admin type situation then trying to hack or make something with PHP. I know about the PHP frameworks out there, but they just don't appeal in this particular situation.</p>

<p>Due to this massive set of HTML files, is it possible to basically allow Django to carry on serving these up as they are... He can edit and upload them with Dreamweaver as he always has... But Django is 'there' for the admin side of it which he can do his newsletter? Eventually he is wanting translations for the pages and login for visitors (again which I'd like to do with Django) but for the time being I'm in this transitional period and wanting to do things step by step.</p>

<p>Aside note, he has a forum that is in PHP, which he also wants to keep... So I'm thinking a carefully setup combination of Nginx, FastCGI and Gunicorn so static, PHP and Django respectively can co-exist on the same server. Is this just foolish, or totally possible?</p>

<p>Any thoughts, guidance, tips or experience would be greatly appreciated so I take the best step forward.</p>

<p>Yes, browsers can resize images based on width and height attributes, however you have no control over the quality of the resized image.  If this is something you care about at all, it should be done server-side.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that even though the resized image is smaller than the original, it is still the same file size as the full-sized image.  Therefore if you're leaving it up to the browser to make a 2MB file 100px by 100px, the user still has to download all 2MB of the file first.</p>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/backrefx/" rel="nofollow">backrefx package</a>.</p>

<p>I was just wondering if the HTML5 API for Drag and Drop included support for touch screen displays.</p>

<p>I was thinking of iPhone, but I know this isn't supported yet.  I was wondering if that is just catching up on the part of Apple, to support HTML5 drag and drop on Safari mobile, but I also was thinking maybe the HTML5 API wasn't powerful enough for this, but I highly doubt that.</p>

<p>How about on a standard touch screen laptop tablet or the like, I don't have one so I can't test but I would imagine that support is included because, as far as I know, that table interface just replaces mouse control, so, as far as the browser is concerned, the end-user is really just using a mouse.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>You are using it wrong. It basically does a coordinate conversion. I'm assuming it starts by converting the rect from the starting view to window coordinates and then converting back from window coordinates to the coordinate system of the second view. Here's an example.</p>

<p>You have two subviews in your window, one with a frame of {{25,0}, {100, 100}}, The other with a frame of {{50, 50}, {200, 200}} You want to translate the following rect {{50, 50}, {50, 50}} from the first subview to the second subview. Here's how it might work.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>convert the rect from the first subview's coordinated to window coordinates:
Since the subview we are starting from has an origin of {25,0} we need to translate it to window coordinates. This can be done by adding the origin of the subview to the origin of the rect, so the new rect in window coordinates is {{75, 50}, {50, 50}}</p></li>
<li><p>convert the new rect from window coordinates to the second subview's coordinates: We start with the rect {{75, 50}, {50, 50}}, The frame of the second subview is {{50, 50}, {200, 200}}. Now we subtract the origin of the second subview to the rect to do our translation. So we end up with a translated rect of {{25, 0}, {50, 50}}</p></li>
</ol>

<p><code>$_POST['check']</code> is never set, thus your code isn't being called, thus nothing is output.  Either remove the check for <code>$_POST['check']</code> in your PHP script, add <code>check: 'First'</code> to the <code>data</code> property to the <code>$.ajax</code> call, or change <code>$_POST</code> to <code>$_GET</code>.</p>

<p>ILDasm will have an entry in the manifest as follows :</p>

<pre><code>.subsystem 0x0003       // WINDOWS_CUI

.subsystem 0x0002       // WINDOWS_GUI
</code></pre>

<p>based on the subsystemtype you can tell if its GUI or CUI.</p>

<p>This information is also available from the following command :</p>

<pre><code>dumpbin ConsoleApplication1.exe /headers
</code></pre>

<p>From your library query for entry assembly and get its full path(Assembly.GetEntryAssembly().CodeBase) and then you can issue any of these command to know the subsystem.</p>

<p>The resizing that happens on the browser is simply that of display - the full image is downloaded and is simply displayed with the required size. What they look like will be determined by some image resizing algorithms written by the browser writers - you have not control over the quality.</p>

<p>It is a matter of bandwidth and possibly CPU and memory usage on the client.</p>

<p>As you surmise, most images are sized beforehand, long before any request. Even with fast CPUs you would not want to do this on the fly.</p>

<p>Smaller images will also mean users that do not have broadband will be able to enjoy your site without waiting for the large images to download.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I'm trying to extract the names from this list:</p>

<pre><code>new String:  blood cz            TheDeAtH              TBH DragonFire   Scotsman          King Kot            BobLeeSwagger          AffeMitWaffe    Jackobo          D L  fatality         Jack bobo           telex             apa           Tiger            zip     Guronzan          noobmaster           fear           piotrekjankiewi         RoCJackal 
</code></pre>

<p>These names will then have to be written into an array. I've done this so far:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *newString = [[test componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet:
       [[NSCharacterSet letterCharacterSet] invertedSet]] 
         componentsJoinedByString:@";"]; //yes there are spaces in the above list, previously they were replaced by ;
</code></pre>

<p>I then load it into an array:</p>

<pre><code> NSArray *chunks = [newString componentsSeparatedByString:@";"];
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but for the name "blood cz" for example, it takes blood and cz as a seperate thing in the array, but i need them to be together.</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea of how I could achieve this? I've been breaking my head over this, because Im not able to seperate the strings. When taking the whitespaces out, its all together and I can seperate the strings, reason being that these strings are being taken from a gameserver website, where playernames change...</p>

<p>Actually, in a way, <code>join</code> is where all the magic really happens--<code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code> is used mostly for convenience.</p>

<p>All <code>Functor</code>-based type classes describe additional structure using some type. With <code>Functor</code> this extra structure is often thought of as a "container", while with <code>Monad</code> it tends to be thought of as "side effects", but those are just (occasionally misleading) shorthands--it's the same thing either way and not really anything special<sup><strong>[0]</strong></sup>.</p>

<p>The distinctive feature of <code>Monad</code> compared to other <code>Functor</code>s is that it can embed <em>control flow</em> into the extra structure. The reason it can do this is that, unlike <code>fmap</code> which applies a single flat function over the entire structure, <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code> inspects individual elements and builds <em>new</em> structure from that. </p>

<p>With a plain <code>Functor</code>, building new structure from each piece of the original structure would instead nest the <code>Functor</code>, with each layer representing a point of control flow. This obviously limits the utility, as the result is messy and has a type that reflects the structure of flow control used.</p>

<p>Monadic "side effects" are structures that have a few additional properties<sup><strong>[1]</strong></sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two side effects can be grouped into one (e.g., "do X" and "do Y" become "do X, then Y"), and the order of grouping doesn't matter so long as the order of the effects is maintained.</li>
<li>A "do nothing" side effect exists (e.g., "do X" and "do nothing" grouped is the same as just "do X")</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>join</code> function is nothing more than that grouping operation: A nested monad type like <code>m (m a)</code> describes two side effects and the order they occur in, and <code>join</code> groups them together into a single side effect.</p>

<p>So, as far as monadic side effects are concerned, the bind operation is a shorthand for "take a value with associated side effects and a function that introduces new side effects, then apply the function to the value while combining the side effects for each".</p>

<p><strong>[0]:</strong> Except <code>IO</code>. <code>IO</code> is <em>very</em> special.</p>

<p><strong>[1]:</strong> If you compare these properties to the rules for an instance of <code>Monoid</code> you'll see close parallels between the two--this is not a coincidence, and is in fact what that "just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?" line is referring to.</p>

<p>If you want to convert PHP array to object in Javascript - you can use function : </p>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php</a></p>

<p><strong>Example from manual:</strong></p>

<pre><code>// PHP
$arr = array ('a'=&gt;1,'b'=&gt;2,'c'=&gt;3,'d'=&gt;4,'e'=&gt;5);
$js = json_encode($arr);
echo $js;

// output
{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5} 
</code></pre>

<p>So you can use PHP to "echo" <code>$js</code> variable to initialize your javascript for example. </p>

<p>For iteration through properties of JS object you can use: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for_in.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for_in.asp</a></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><code>for (key in objectInstance)
{
  alert(objectInstance[key]); // value
}
</code></pre>

<p>Detecting correct encoding of a given text is not exact science. All above software are approximations. </p>

<p>There's more, what if your library method is called from a worker thread?  You didn't tell why you need to know, preventing a good answer.  One approach is that the app that uses your library never has any trouble knowing whether its console or WPF.  Expose a property to allow it to tell you.  Another is using events so the app can simply implement the event handler to its liking.  Dependency Injection is another.</p>

<p>hello,
 i need to restart my php program when the memory of the program exceeds 500 mb ...
it can be done by any script in php or in shell ????</p>

<p>Well, you could use <code>with</code>, but <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2006/04/11/with-statement-considered-harmful/" rel="nofollow"><code>with</code> is considered harmful</a>:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = { bar: 'foo' };

with (obj) {
    alert(bar); // 'foo'
}

alert(bar); // undefined
</code></pre>

<p>If you must have the loop, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = { bar: 'foo' };
var key, value;

with (obj) {
    for (key in obj) {
        if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {  // Never forget this check!
            continue;
        }

        value = obj[key];

        // Rest of loop here.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you are discovering, maintaining parallel arrays can be a hassle and error prone. An alternative approach is to keep related information together.</p>

<pre><code>use strict;
use warnings;

# One array-of-hashes instead of three parallel arrays.
my @numbers = (
    { arabic =&gt; 7, text =&gt; 'seven', roman =&gt; 'VII' },
    { arabic =&gt; 2, text =&gt; 'two',   roman =&gt; 'II'  },
    { arabic =&gt; 9, text =&gt; 'nine',  roman =&gt; 'IX'  },
);

@numbers = sort { $a-&gt;{arabic} &lt;=&gt; $b-&gt;{arabic} } @numbers;
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to do a press Q to quit thing in the console window. I dont like my current implementation. Is there a way i can async or use a callback to get keys from the console? </p>

<p>Add an action to the touch down event and you are being touched up until any of the touch up events are fired.  If you need to be continuously called, use an NSTimer.  Start the timer on touch down and then check to see if you are still down in the timer handler.  If you are, do your thing and set another timer.</p>

<p>While I agree with eugene y and MvanGeest that usually the best answer is to switch to another data structure, sometimes you might <em>want</em> parallel arrays (or at least, might not be able to avoid them), and there actually <em>is</em> a way to sort parallel arrays in parallel. It goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>my @nums = (7, 2, 9);
my @names = qw(seven two nine);
my @roman = qw(VII II IX);

my @sorted_indices = sort { $nums[$a] &lt;=&gt; $nums[$b] } 0..$#nums;
@$_ = @{$_}[@sorted_indices] for \(@nums, @names, @roman);
</code></pre>

<p>That is, generate a list of the <em>indices</em> that correspond to all of the arrays, and then sort them according to the order that will put the "primary" array in order. Once we have the sorted list of indices, re-order all of the arrays to match.</p>

<p>The final line could be written out longhand as</p>

<pre><code>@nums = @nums[@sorted_indices];
@names = @names[@sorted_indices];
@roman = @roman[@sorted_indices];
</code></pre>

<p>but I tried to reduce the amount of copy-paste necessary, even at the cost of some slightly hairy syntax. The More You Know... </p>

<p>I personaly do image resizing (thumbnails) on server and keep them in separate folder. This helps me to keep bandwidth low. </p>

<p>If you do not want to store them on your server and just do it on request (online) you can use cool scripts like e.g. <strong>TimThumb</strong> is : <a href="http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/04/02/timthumb-php-script-released/" rel="nofollow">http://www.darrenhoyt.com/2008/04/02/timthumb-php-script-released/</a></p>

<p>Everyting depends on your server's load and number of images per page (or traffic of course)
If you want to store them on your server then you can use http://<strong>phpthumb</strong>.sourceforge.net/ or <strong>ImageMagick</strong> (I use it for thumbnails + watermarks)</p>

<p>This is from the <a href="https://www.dreamspark.com/FAQ/Default.aspx?i=gen#" rel="nofollow">DreamSpark faq</a> (which is probably the program you got it through):</p>

<p>From a MSDN blog:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>See <a href="http://www.msstudentlounge.com/forums/tabid/65/forumid/6/postid/729/scope/posts/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> thread - for the single exception:</p>

<p>Good day!</p>

<p>I'm learning to create AJAX calls to PHP scripts. </p>

<p>Basically, I want to find the best solution to handle AJAX calls. In <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3382174/jquery-ajax-call-how-to-handle">this</a> question you can find my client-side part of the code.</p>

<p>Basically, I'd like to verify my knowledge here and if I'm wrong, get any tips how to make it correct way.</p>

<p>So... I'm using KohanaPHP framework (but also going to learn ZendFramework). I created a test controller with following code:</p>

<pre><code>public function __construct() 
{
    if (request::is_ajax()) {
        $this-&gt;auto_render = FALSE;
        header('content-type: application/json');
    }
}

public function index()
{
    $result['success'] = 1;

    $test_model = new Test_Model;
    $items = $test_model-&gt;get_test_rows();
    foreach($items as $item):
        $rows[] = $item;
    endforeach;     
    $result['rows'] = json_encode($rows);

    if (request::is_ajax()) {
        echo json_encode($result);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I got few questions related to this code. Let me ask them.</p>

<p>1) In thread mentioned above I was told I do not have to use <code>$.parseJSON();</code> function and I can use <code>data.rows[0]name</code> instead. Unfortunately, it does not work. For the is't not a big problem, I can use <code>$.parseJSON();</code> but I'd like to know if there's any bug in my PHP code?</p>

<p>2) I'm trying to learn good practices and techniques and I'm try to not violate MVC rules. I have a MVC related question. Is it possible to use <code>echo()</code> in controllers? You may notice I'm using it to return JSON encoded data.</p>

<p>Hello !</p>

<p>I'm currently using this clickable map (<a href="http://winstonwolf.pl/css,europe.html" rel="nofollow">Wolf's map</a>) but I would like to use a second li list of countries in addition of the one that serves as a foundation for the script. The second menu cannot be in the same DIV as the map for presentation reasons. I've been searching through the JQuery documentation to understand how I can trigger an action on another element than the one selected but I'm not sure I've got it right - probably not as it is not working.</p>

<p>The original script looks like this :</p>

<pre><code>    $(document).ready(function(){

 var new_map='&lt;span class="map"&gt;&lt;span class="s1" /&gt;&lt;span class="s2" /&gt;&lt;span class="s3" /&gt;&lt;span class="s4" /&gt;&lt;span class="s5" /&gt;&lt;span class="s6" /&gt;&lt;span class="s7" /&gt;&lt;span class="s8" /&gt;&lt;span class="s9" /&gt;&lt;span class="s10" /&gt;&lt;span class="s11" /&gt;&lt;span class="s12" /&gt;&lt;span class="s13" /&gt;&lt;span class="s14" /&gt;&lt;span class="s15" /&gt;&lt;span class="s16" /&gt;&lt;span class="s17" /&gt;&lt;span class="s18" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;';
 var new_bg=$("&lt;span&gt;");
 new_bg.addClass("bg");
 $("#europe li a").append(new_map);
 $("#europe li a").append(new_bg);

});
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to do is to trigger the same action when hovering another element that is not #europe li a. I have tried this :</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

 var new_map='&lt;span class="map"&gt;&lt;span class="s1" /&gt;&lt;span class="s2" /&gt;&lt;span class="s3" /&gt;&lt;span class="s4" /&gt;&lt;span class="s5" /&gt;&lt;span class="s6" /&gt;&lt;span class="s7" /&gt;&lt;span class="s8" /&gt;&lt;span class="s9" /&gt;&lt;span class="s10" /&gt;&lt;span class="s11" /&gt;&lt;span class="s12" /&gt;&lt;span class="s13" /&gt;&lt;span class="s14" /&gt;&lt;span class="s15" /&gt;&lt;span class="s16" /&gt;&lt;span class="s17" /&gt;&lt;span class="s18" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;';
 var new_bg=$("&lt;span&gt;");
 new_bg.addClass("bg");
 $("#carteeurope li a").append(new_map);
 $("#carteeurope li a").append(new_bg);

 $("#menudroite li a").hover(function(){
 $(new_map).appendTo("#carteeurope li a");
 $(new_bg).appendTo("#carteeurope li a");
 });

});
</code></pre>

<p>It makes something but not the desired effect : it looks like the map can move indeed but not to the good positions (some countries get a white background after several hovers on the second menu).</p>

<p>I would be very grateful if you could help me !</p>

<p>Regards.</p>

<p>PS : some relevant HTML and CSS parts.</p>

<p>The original list</p>

<p>No, dynamic typing is when values have type but variables do not, so most type checking is done at runtime. So, basically, if the value walks or quacks like a duck, it's a duck, else an error is thrown. Duck typing really just describes a feature of dynamic typing that ensures it will be typesafe (i.e. a method will only run if variable <code>foo</code>'has the right attribute or can execute that method).</p>
